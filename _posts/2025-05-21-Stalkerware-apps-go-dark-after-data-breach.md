A stalkerware company that recently leaked millions of usersâ€™ personal information online has taken all of its assets offline without any explanation. Now Malwarebytes has learned that the company has taken down other apps too.

Back in February, news emerged of a stalkerware app compromise. Reporters at Techcrunch revealed a vulnerability in three such apps: Spyzie, Cocospy, and Spyic. The flaw exposed data from the victimâ€™s devices, rendering their messages, photos, and location data visible to whomever wanted them. It also gave up approximately 3.2 million email addresses entered by the customers that bought and installed these apps on their targetsâ€™ devices.

The bug was so easy to exploit that Techcrunch and the researcher involved wouldnâ€™t divulge it, to protect the compromised details.
