## AT&T Breach Data Resurfaces with New Risks for Customers 🚨

A newly shared dataset tied to AT&T reveals alarming risks for customers. This dataset, privately circulated since February 2, 2026, includes approximately **176 million records** containing sensitive information such as:

- **148 million Social Security numbers** (full SSNs and last four digits)
- **133 million full names and street addresses**
- **132 million phone numbers**
- **75 million dates of birth**
- **131 million email addresses**

When data resurfaces, it often becomes more dangerous. Attackers can leverage this information to craft convincing phishing emails and texts, conduct **SIM-swap attempts**, and engage in long-term identity theft. The risk escalates when attackers can see a person's name, address, phone number, email, SSN, and date of birth all in one place.

### What Can You Do? 🤔
If you have ever been an AT&T customer, it's crucial to treat this as a reminder that your data may be circulating among criminals. Here are some steps you can take to protect yourself:
- Enable **multi-factor authentication** wherever possible.
- Lock down your mobile account with extra passcodes.
- Consider monitoring your credit.

Stay vigilant and cautious of any AT&T-related communications. You can't pull your data back from a criminal dataset, but you can make it harder for them to use it against you.
