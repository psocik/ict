Google Threat Intelligence Group‚Äôs (GTIG) mission is to protect Google‚Äôs billions of users and Google‚Äôs multitude of products and services. In late October 2024, GTIG discovered an exploited government website hosting malware being used to target multiple other government entities. The exploited site delivered a malware payload, which we have dubbed ‚ÄúTOUGHPROGRESS,‚Äù that took advantage of Google Calendar for command and control (C2). Misuse of cloud services for C2 is a technique that many threat actors leverage in order to blend in with legitimate activity.  

We assess with high confidence that this malware is being used by the PRC based actor APT41 (also tracked as HOODOO). APT41‚Äôs targets span the globe, including governments and organizations within the global shipping and logistics, media and entertainment, technology, and automotive sectors.  

In this blog post, we analyze the malware delivery methods, technical details of the malware attack chain, discuss other recent APT41 activities, and share indicators of compromise (IOCs) to help security practitioners defend against similar attacks. We also detail how GTIG disrupted this campaign using custom detection signatures, shutting down attacker-controlled infrastructure, and protections added to Safe Browsing.
