A Rotherham man has been sentenced to 20 months behind bars for a range of hacktivism-related offenses. Al-Tahery Al-Mashriky, 26, was arrested in 2022 by National Crime Agency (NCA) officers after they were tipped off by US investigators. Most of his offending was linked to the unauthorized access to and defacement of official websites including the Yemen Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Yemen Ministry of Security Media, and Israeli Live News. After hacking the sites, he would download tools to scan for usernames and vulnerabilities, the NCA claimed. These hinted at a more serious plan to commit large-scale identity fraud or potentially sell the data on to others.

Al-Mashriky was due to stand trial for 10 Computer Misuse Act offenses at Sheffield Crown Court in March but pleaded guilty to nine of them on March 17. He was sentenced in the same court on Friday.
