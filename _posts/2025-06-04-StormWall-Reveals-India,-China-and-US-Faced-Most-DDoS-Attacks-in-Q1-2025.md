A new report from cybersecurity firm StormWall reveals that nearly half of all DDoS attacks in the first quarter of 2025 were aimed at China, India, and the United States. Instead of focusing heavily on the usual targets, attackers are now directing more of their efforts toward infrastructure in the Asia-Pacific region.

According to StormWallâ€™s analytics center, India topped the chart with 18.1% of the global DDoS traffic, followed by China at 16.2% and the US at 14.7%. Japan (12.3%) and Taiwan (10.2%) rounded out the top five. When it comes to industry-wise attacks, Telecommunications became the top target in APAC, with 136% year-over-year (YOY) growth.

Four of the five most targeted countries now sit in the APAC region, with 57% of all malicious requests focused there. This shows that attackers are moving their focus away from the usual targets in Europe and North America, at least for now. The reasons may be geopolitical, economic, or a combination of both.
