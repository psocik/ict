A new report from the U.S. GAO detailed that policies and actions implemented under the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 have positively contributed to the sharing of cyber threat information between federal and nonfederal entities. Sharing such information can enhance awareness of the extent of current cyber threats and how to mitigate those threats. The agency highlighted the actions of seven agencies designated to implement the act, including the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, Defense, Commerce, Energy, and the Treasury; and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.  

The watchdog observed that malicious cyberattacks on the federal government and the nationâ€™s critical infrastructures, such as electricity and healthcare, are growing in number, impact, and sophistication and have led to significant disruptions. It also identified that ransomware attacks on the healthcare and public health sector have had severe consequences. However, cyber information sharing helped improve awareness of the scope of current cyber threats and the strategies needed to mitigate them.
