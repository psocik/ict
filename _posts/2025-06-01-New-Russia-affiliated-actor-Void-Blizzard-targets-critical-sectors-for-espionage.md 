Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center has discovered a cluster of worldwide cloud abuse activity conducted by a threat actor we track as Void Blizzard (LAUNDRY BEAR), who we assess with high confidence is Russia-affiliated and has been active since at least April 2024. While Void Blizzard has a global reach, their cyberespionage activity disproportionately targets NATO member states and Ukraine, indicating that the actor is likely collecting intelligence to help support Russian strategic objectives. In particular, the threat actor’s prolific activity against networks in critical sectors poses a heightened risk to NATO member states and allies to Ukraine in general.

Void Blizzard’s cyberespionage operations tend to be highly targeted at specific organizations of interest to the Russian government, including in government, defense, transportation, media, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and healthcare sectors primarily in Europe and North America. The threat actor uses stolen credentials—which are likely procured from commodity infostealer ecosystems—and collects a high volume of email and files from compromised organizations.
