One of the things we’re most proud of at DomainTools is our Grants program. We offer free access and training to investigative journalists, as well as security researchers involved in community-benefiting projects. Yearly presentations at the NICAR investigative reporter conference allow us to share techniques utilizing passive DNS and other domain intelligence that often prove useful in journalism as well. We also provide technical guidance and review, which sometimes brings us deep into third-party investigations. While our grantees are provided confidentiality by default, we recently engaged with a grantee investigation which the stakeholders gave us permission to talk about in the clear.

In this post, we’ll talk about the DomainTools side of the investigation and technical observables. For the deeper context of the stories, please see the original reporting at Frontstory.pl. (An English-language article will be added here when published.)
