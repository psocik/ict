The digital frontlines of the Israel-Gaza conflict have rapidly evolved into an active and persistent cyber battlefield. Over the past year, multiple pro-Palestinian threat groups, including Handala and Cyber Toufan, have launched coordinated campaigns targeting Israeli organizations.

These attacks go beyond typical cybercrime; they are politically motivated operations designed to disrupt, destabilize, and damage. Since late 2023, Cyber Toufan (Arabic for "cyber storm") has claimed responsibility for over 100 breaches across sectors including government, defense, finance, and critical infrastructure.

Over the past months, the OP Innovate Incident Response (IR) team has investigated three confirmed Cyber Toufan intrusions.

Each case followed a consistent pattern: initial access via weak or reused credentials without MFA, stealthy lateral movement across the network, and coordinated data leak campaigns distributed publicly via Telegram. Unlike traditional APTs that rely on sophisticated zero-days, these actors exploit poor security hygiene, turning basic negligence into their primary attack vector.
