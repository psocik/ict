What is the Interlock ransomware?

Interlock is a relatively new strain of ransomware, that first emerged in late 2024. Unlike many other ransomware families it not only targets Windows PCs, but also systems running FreeBSD.

If you are impacted, you will find that your files have not only been encrypted but have also had ".interlock" appended to their filenames. For example, a file named report.xlsx would become report.xlsx.interlock, visibly signaling that it has been encrypted by Interlock.
