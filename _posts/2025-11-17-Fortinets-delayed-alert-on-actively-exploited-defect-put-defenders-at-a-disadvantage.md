The security vendor silently patched a vulnerability, but did not assign the flaw a CVE or publicly disclose its existence until 17 days later. By then, widespread attacks were already underway.

Federal authorities and researchers alerted organizations Friday to a massively exploited vulnerability in Fortinet’s web application firewall.

While the actively exploited critical defect poses significant risk to Fortinet’s customers, researchers are particularly agitated about the vendor’s delayed communications and, ultimately, post-exploitation warnings about the vulnerability.

Fortinet addressed CVE-2025-64446 in a software update pushed Oct. 28, but did not assign the flaw a CVE or publicly disclose its existence until last week — 17 days later — when the company also confirmed the vulnerability has been exploited in the wild.

By then, for some Fortinet customers, especially those that hadn’t updated to FortiWeb 8.0.2, it was too late. The path-traversal defect in FortiWeb, which has a CVSS rating of 9.8, allows attackers to execute administrative commands resulting in a complete takeover of the compromised device.
