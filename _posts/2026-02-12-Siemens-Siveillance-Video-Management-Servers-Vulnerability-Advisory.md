As a general security measure, Siemens strongly advises protecting network access to affected products with appropriate mechanisms.

### CISA Recommendations
Additionally, CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the exploitation risk of these vulnerabilities. CISA advises minimizing network exposure for all control system devices and ensuring they are not accessible from the internet. Control system networks and remote devices should be located behind firewalls and isolated from business networks. When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as **Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)**, while recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most recent version available. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.
