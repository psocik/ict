Cisco has released security updates to address a high-severity zero-day vulnerability in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software that is currently being exploited in attacks.

Tracked as CVE-2025-20352, the flaw is due to a stack-based buffer overflow weakness found in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) subsystem of vulnerable IOS and IOS XE software, impacting all devices with SNMP enabled.

Authenticated, remote attackers with low privileges can exploit this vulnerability to trigger denial-of-service (DoS) conditions on unpatched devices. High-privileged attackers, on the other hand, can gain complete control of systems running vulnerable Cisco IOS XE software by executing code as the root user.

"An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SNMP packet to an affected device over IPv4 or IPv6 networks," Cisco said in a Wednesday advisory.
