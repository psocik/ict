**Key Findings**  
Silent Push Threat Analysts have uncovered a massive “fake marketplace” scam campaign we have dubbed “GhostVendors” involving online ads that impersonate dozens of major brands and spoof actual products on thousands of fraudulent websites.  

We found over 4,000 domains that are part of this fake marketplace network. This is a significant threat targeting social networks, major brands, advertising companies, and consumers worldwide.  

During our research, we found that after the threat actor posted its malicious Facebook Marketplace ads for a few days, it stopped its campaigns, thereby deleting all traces of them from the Meta Ad Library.  

We determined that the threat actors are exploiting an existing Meta policy to target major brands and then completely remove previously posted ads.
