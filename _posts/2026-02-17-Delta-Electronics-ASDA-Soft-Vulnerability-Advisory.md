## Delta Electronics ASDA-Soft Vulnerability Advisory 🚨

**Date Published:** February 17, 2026

A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability (CVE-2026-1361) exists in ASDA_Soft version 7.2.0.0 when parsing .par files. The root cause is the improper validation of a user-controlled size parameter, which is checked incorrectly against the upper limits of the local buffer. This allows data to be written past the end of the buffer. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an attacker to write arbitrary data beyond the bounds of a stack-allocated buffer, leading to the corruption of a structured exception handler (SEH). The following versions of Delta Electronics ASDA-Soft are affected: ASDA-Soft <= 7.2.0.0.

**Impact:** This vulnerability is relevant to CWE: CWE-121 Stack-based Buffer Overflow and affects critical infrastructure sectors, specifically Critical Manufacturing.

Delta has fixed this vulnerability and released a new version v7.2.2.0 at the Delta Download Center. For more information, users can refer to Delta Electronics advisory Delta-PCSA-2026-00003 at [Delta Electronics Advisory](https://www.deltaww.com/en-US/service-support/product-cybersecurity/advisory).
