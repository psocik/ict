Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new campaign that employs a previously undocumented ransomware family called Charon to target the Middle East's public sector and aviation industry.

The threat actor behind the activity, according to Trend Micro, exhibited tactics mirroring those of advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, such as DLL side-loading, process injection, and the ability to evade endpoint detection and response (EDR) software.

The DLL side-loading techniques resemble those previously documented as part of attacks orchestrated by a China-linked hacking group called Earth Baxia, which was flagged by the cybersecurity company as targeting government entities in Taiwan and the Asia-Pacific region to deliver a backdoor known as EAGLEDOOR following the exploitation of a now-patched security flaw affecting OSGeo GeoServer GeoTools.

Statistics shared by Barracuda show that 57% of organizations experienced a successful ransomware attack in the last 12 months, of which 71% that had experienced an email breach were also hit with ransomware. What's more, 32% paid a ransom, but only 41% of the victims got all their data back.
