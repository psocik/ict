## Key Takeaways  
Raspberry Robin is an advanced malware downloader that has been active since 2021.  

The developers have improved the malwareâ€™s obfuscation methods by adding multiple initialization loops to functions with a flattened control flow, making brute-force decryption less efficient.  

The network encryption algorithm has changed from AES (CTR mode) to Chacha-20.  

Raspberry Robin has added a new local privilege escalation (LPE) exploit (CVE-2024-38196) to gain elevated privileges on targeted systems.  

The malware embeds invalid command-and-control (C2) server (TOR onion) domains.  

Certain values, such as the RC4 key seed, are randomized per sample/campaign.
