This week, Pakistan’s National Cyber Emergency Response Team (NCERT) has issued an advisory to 39 key ministries and institutions, warning them of a “severe risk” posed by the ongoing ‘Blue Locker’ malware attacks. An NCERT spokesperson confirmed on Sunday that a few Pakistani organizations have been affected by the ransomware.

Resecurity has acquired binary samples of the "Blue Locker" ransomware and provided a detailed reverse engineering analysis in this report to raise awareness within the cybersecurity community and equip network defenders with additional insights due to limited information about this activity.

**Indicator of Compromise (IOC)**
Besides the IOCs shared by NCERT, Resecurity acquired additional artifacts that may be useful in "Blue Locker" ransomware detection:
