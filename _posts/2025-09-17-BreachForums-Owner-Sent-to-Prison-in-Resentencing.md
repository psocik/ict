Fitzpatrick was now resentenced to three years in prison for his role in operating BreachForums and for possessing child sexual abuse material.

Launched in March 2022 and also known as Breached, BreachForums became one of the largest cybercrime marketplaces, growing to over 330,000 members after cybercrime marketplace RaidForums was seized by law enforcement in February 2022. During its one-year existence, BreachForums became popular for selling personally identifying information (PII), usernames and passwords, and bank account information.

The marketplace maintained and offered roughly 890 data sets of stolen information containing over 14 billion individual records of PII, the US Department of Justice says. These datasets contained, among others, information on millions of users of telecommunications providers, social networking sites, and healthcare services. One database contained details on 87,760 members of InfraGard (an FBI-private sector partnership for protecting critical infrastructure).
