Threat actors predominately exploited public-facing applications for initial access this quarter, with this tactic appearing in over 60 percent of Cisco Talos Incident Response (Talos IR) engagements â€“ a notable increase from less than 10 percent last quarter. This spike is largely attributable to a wave of engagements involving ToolShell, an attack chain that targets on-premises Microsoft SharePoint servers through exploitation of vulnerabilities that were publicly disclosed in July. We also saw an increase in post-exploitation phishing campaigns launched from compromised valid accounts this quarter, a trend we noted last quarter, with threat actors using this technique to expand their attack both within the compromised organizations as well as to external partner entities.  

Ransomware incidents made up only approximately 20 percent of engagements this quarter, a decrease from 50 percent last quarter, despite ransomware remaining one of the most persistent threats to organizations. Talos IR responded to Warlock, Babuk, and Kraken ransomware variants for the first time, while also responding to previously seen families Qilin and LockBit. We observed an attack we attributed with moderate confidence to the threat actor that Microsoft tracks as China-based group Storm-2603 based on overlapping tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). As part of their attack chain, the actors leveraged open-source digital forensics and incident response (DFIR) platform Velociraptor for persistence, a tool that has not been previously seen in ransomware attacks or associated with Storm-2603. We also responded to more Qilin ransomware engagements than last quarter, supporting our assessment from last quarter that the threat group is likely accelerating the cadence of their attacks.
