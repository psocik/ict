A threat actor has compromised 850,000 Orange Belgium customer accounts, with SIM card numbers and Personal Unblocking Key (PUK) codes among the data potentially accessed.

The PUK code is an eight-digit security code that can be used to unlock a SIM card if an incorrect PIN is entered several times.

The attack on Orange Belgium has been claimed by the Warlock ransomware group. The ransomware group monitoring platform Ransomware.live revealed the actor has posted a sample of data it purportedly stole from the company on its data leak site. The Warlock group has stated that the full dataset is available for sale.
