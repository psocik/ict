A novel attack technique could be weaponized to rope thousands of public domain controllers (DCs) around the world to create a malicious botnet and use it to conduct powerful distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. The approach has been codenamed Win-DDoS by SafeBreach researchers Or Yair and Shahak Morag, who presented their findings at the DEF CON 33 security conference today.

"As we explored the intricacies of the Windows LDAP client code, we discovered a significant flaw that allowed us to manipulate the URL referral process to point DCs at a victim server to overwhelm it," Yair and Morag said in a report shared with The Hacker News. As a result, we were able to create Win-DDoS, a technique that would enable an attacker to harness the power of tens of thousands of public DCs around the world to create a malicious botnet with vast resources and upload rates. All without purchasing anything and without leaving a traceable footprint.
