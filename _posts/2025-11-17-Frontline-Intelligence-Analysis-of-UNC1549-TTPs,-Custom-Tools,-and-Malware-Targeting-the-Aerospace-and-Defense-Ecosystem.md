Last year, Mandiant published a blog post highlighting suspected Iran-nexus espionage activity targeting the aerospace, aviation, and defense industries in the Middle East. In this follow-up post, Mandiant discusses additional tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) observed in incidents Mandiant has responded to.\n\nUNC1549's operations appear strongly motivated by espionage, with mission objectives centering around extensive data collection from targeted networks. The group actively seeks sensitive information, including network/IT documentation, intellectual property, and emails. Furthermore, UNC1549 often leverages compromised organizations as a pivot point, using their access to target other entities, particularly those within the same industry sector, effectively conducting third-party supplier and partner intrusions to further their intelligence-gathering goals.\n\nNotably, Mandiant responded to one intrusion at an organization in an unrelated sector, and assessed that the intrusion was opportunistic due to the initial spear phishing lure being related to a job at an aerospace and defense organization. This demonstrated UNC1549’s ability to commit resources to expanding access and persistence in victim organizations that don’t immediately meet traditional espionage goals.\n\nTo read the complete article see: [Analysis of UNC1549 TTPs Targeting Aerospace Defense](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/analysis-of-unc1549-ttps-targeting-aerospace-defense) • 🔗
