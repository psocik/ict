Apple recently issued a spyware campaign alert, according to the French Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-FR).

The national incident response organization, operated by the French national cybersecurity agency (ANSSI), issued its new advisory on September 11.

In the document, CERT-FR said that Apple notified users of a new spyware campaign a week earlier, on September 3.

CERT-FR explained that receiving such a notification means that at least one device linked to an iCloud account has been targeted and may potentially be compromised.

CERT-FR noted that Apple has been very proactive since 2021 in its fight against commercial spyware, with regular notifications to potential targets for the past four years.

It noted that Apple sent at least four notifications in 2025, on March 5, April 25, June 25 and September 3.
