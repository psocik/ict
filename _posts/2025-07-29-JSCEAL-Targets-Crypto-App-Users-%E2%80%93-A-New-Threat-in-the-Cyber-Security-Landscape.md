Key Points:

Check Point Research has discovered the JSCEAL campaign, which targets crypto app users by leveraging malicious advertisements.

The campaign uses fake applications impersonating popular cryptocurrency trading apps, with over 35,000 malicious ads served in the first half of 2025, generating millions of impressions in the EU alone.

JSCEAL malware, which is delivered through sophisticated multi-layered infection flows, steals cryptocurrency-related data like credentials and wallets, making it a serious threat to crypto app users.

The campaign utilizes a modular structure, enabling attackers to adapt new tactics and payloads as needed, making it difficult for traditional security mechanisms to detect and prevent.
