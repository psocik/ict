A set of 18 malicious browser extensions that are still available to download on Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge have been identified by a team of security researchers at Koi Security.

These extensions masquerade as productivity and entertainment tools across diverse categories, including emoji keyboards, weather forecasts, video speed controllers, VPN proxies for Discord and TikTok, dark themes, volume boosters, and YouTube unblockers.

They all offer a functional service, which is advertised, while secretly implementing browser surveillance and hijacking capabilities. They have infected over 2.3 million browser users to date.

Several of these extensions were verified by Google and Microsoft or had featured placement on the Chrome Web Store or the Edge Add-ons Store.
