Bitsight analysts identified this activity as the work of a novel botnet they dubbed RapperBot, noting its unusually rapid kill chain and innovative use of legacy hardware constraints to evade detection.

Despite its potency, the malwareâ€™s behavior is elegantly simple: it mounts a remote NFS share to fetch and execute architecture-specific binaries, then self-deletes to run entirely in memory.

RapperBotâ€™s infection vector capitalizes on the administrative port (TCP 34567) of vulnerable NVRs. Upon identifying an exposed device, the attacker exploits a path traversal flaw to download account configuration files, revealing both hashed and plaintext credentials. With these credentials, the attacker initiates a fake firmware update, sending a ZIP-formatted payload over the proprietary update protocol.
