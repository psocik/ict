Talos reported 5 vulnerabilities to Broadcom and Dell affecting both the ControlVault3 Firmware and its associated Windows APIs that they are calling “ReVault”.

100+ models of Dell laptops are affected by this vulnerability if left unpatched.

The ReVault attack can be used as a post-compromise persistence technique that can remain even across Windows reinstalls. The ReVault attack can also be used as a physical compromise to bypass Windows Login and/or for any local user to gain Admin/System privileges.
