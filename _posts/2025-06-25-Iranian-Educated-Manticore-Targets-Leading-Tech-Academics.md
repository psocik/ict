## Key findings  

Amid ongoing tensions between Iran and Israel, the Iranian threat group Educated Manticore, associated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, has launched spear-phishing campaigns targeting Israeli journalists, high-profile cyber security experts, and computer science professors from leading Israeli universities.

In some of those campaigns, Israeli technology and cyber security professionals were approached by attackers who posed as fictitious assistants to technology executives or researchers through emails and WhatsApp messages.

The threat actors directed victims who engaged with them to fake Gmail login pages or Google Meet invitations. Credentials entered on these phishing pages are sent to the attackers, enabling them to intercept both passwords and 2FA codes and gain unauthorized access to the victims’ accounts.

Check Point Research continues to track the large and evolving cluster of infrastructure used to facilitate credential harvesting in support of Educated Manticore’s cyber-espionage activities.
