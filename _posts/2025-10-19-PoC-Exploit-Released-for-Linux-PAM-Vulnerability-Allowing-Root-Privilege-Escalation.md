A high-severity vulnerability in the Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) framework was assigned the identifier CVE-2025-8941. This vulnerability stems from the heart of Linux operating systems, enabling attackers with local access to exploit symlink attacks and race conditions for full root privilege escalation.

According to Ameebaâ€™s blog, the vulnerability resides in the pam_namespace module, which manages namespaces for user sessions. A mishandling of user-controlled paths allows crafty attackers to insert symbolic links that hijack directory creation processes.

By exploiting a race condition where timing aligns perfectly, the attacker tricks the system into building sensitive structures on the root filesystem. Real-world exploitation would require sophisticated scripting and precise synchronization, but success grants root-level control, enabling malware deployment or data exfiltration.
