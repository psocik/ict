**Key Takeaways**

UNC3886 is an APT group that has historically targeted critical infrastructure, including telecommunications, government, technology, and defense, with a recent attack against Singapore.

The group is known for rapidly exploiting zero-day and high-impact vulnerabilities in network and virtualization devices such as VMware vCenter/ESXi, Fortinet FortiOS, and Juniper Junos OS.

UNC3886 deploys custom toolsets including TinyShell (a covert remote access tool) and Reptile (a stealthy Linux rootkit), and Medusa, leveraging layered persistence and advanced defense evasion methods such as rootkit deployment, living-off-the-land tactics, and replacement/backdooring of core system binaries.
