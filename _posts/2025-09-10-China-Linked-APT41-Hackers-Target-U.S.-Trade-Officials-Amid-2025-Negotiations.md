The House Select Committee on China has formally issued an advisory warning of an "ongoing" series of highly targeted cyber espionage campaigns linked to the People's Republic of China (PRC) amid contentious U.S.â€“China trade talks.  

The committee noted that suspected threat actors from China impersonated Republican Party Congressman John Robert Moolenaar in phishing emails sent to trusted counterparts with an aim to deceive them and trick them into opening files and links that would grant them unauthorized access to their systems and sensitive information without their knowledge.  

"Your insights are essential," the contents of the message allegedly read, along with an attachment containing a draft version of the legislation that, when launched, deployed malware to gather sensitive data and gain entrenched access to the targeted organizations.  

The attack is believed to be the work of APT41, a prolific hacking group known for its targeting of diverse sectors and geographies for cyber espionage.
