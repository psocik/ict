Check Point Research is tracking a long-running campaign by the Iranian threat actor **Nimbus Manticore**, which overlaps with UNC1549, Smoke Sandstorm, and the “Iranian Dream Job” operations. The ongoing campaign targets defense manufacturing, telecommunications, and aviation that are aligned with IRGC strategic priorities.

The attacker uses previously undocumented low-level APIs to establish a multi-stage DLL side-loading chain. This causes a legitimate process to sideload a malicious DLL from a different location and override the normal DLL search order.

The Nimbus Manticore toolset includes the **MiniJunk** backdoor and the **MiniBrowse** stealer. The tools continuously evolve to remain covert, leveraging valid digital signatures, inflate binary sizes, and use multi-stage sideloading and heavy, compiler-level obfuscation that renders samples be “irreversible” for regular advanced static analysis.

The MiniJunk and MiniBrowse samples that we investigated exhibit heavy compiler-level code obfuscation, possibly implemented via custom LLVM passes. We had to address several obfuscation techniques to facilitate analysis, including junk code insertion, control-flow obfuscation, opaque predicates, obfuscated function calls, and encrypted strings. The attacker invested significant effort in developing these LLVM passes and continues to refine them; each “generation” of samples shows improvements over the previous one, typically introduced between campaigns.
