Many hackers are opportunistic and often attempt to exploit security gaps to launch an attack days before a vulnerability is disclosed.

According to a new report published on July 31 by GreyNoise, attacker activity precedes the time a new vulnerability in edge devices is publicly disclosed and given a common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE) number in 80% of cases.

These pre-disclosure spikes of activity include scanning, brute forcing and exploitation attempts â€“ although zero-day exploit attempts represent the majority of the activity observed. This activity can precede the CVE disclosure by up to six weeks, the GreyNoise researchers found.
