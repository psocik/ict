Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters threaten Google, demanding that two security experts, one from Google’s Threat Intelligence Group and the other from Mandiant, be fired or they will leak alleged stolen Google data.

The group behind the threat calls itself “Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters,” a coalition that combines the tactics and branding of Scattered Spider, Lapsus$, and ShinyHunters. They singled out “worker 1” from Google’s Threat Intelligence Group and “worker 2,” a cybersecurity researcher who joined Google after it acquired Mandiant.

The Telegram message was explicit in tone. It warned that unless worker 1 and worker 2 were terminated and Google Threat Intelligence Group and Mandiant stopped investigating activity attributed to UNC3944, UNC5537, UNC6040, UNC6240, and UNC6395, the group would leak data they claim to have obtained from Google.
