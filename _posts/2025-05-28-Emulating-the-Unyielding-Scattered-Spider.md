Scattered Spider, also known as 0ktapus, Starfraud, UNC3944, Scatter Swine, Octo Tempest, and Muddled Libra, is a financially motivated cybercriminal group active since at least mid-2022. They primarily target large enterprises across multiple industries such as telecommunications, technology, finance, and retail. The group is known for sophisticated social engineering tactics, often impersonating IT staff to gain initial access and conducting multi-factor authentication (MFA) fatigue attacks or SIM swap operations.

Once inside a network, Scattered Spider leverages a mix of Remote Management Tools, Living Off the Land Binaries (LOLBins), tools like Mimikatz and Impacket, and malware such as stealers, Remote Access Trojans (RATs), and ransomware. The group has been linked to ransomware operations including ALPHV/BlackCat and DragonForce, for which AttackIQ has developed in-depth emulation content.

The group was attributed the September 2023 breach of MGM Resorts International, where they disrupted operations and caused major financial damage. While not yet officially confirmed, Scattered Spider is suspected to be behind recent attacks targeting Marks & Spencer, Co-Op, and Harrods.
