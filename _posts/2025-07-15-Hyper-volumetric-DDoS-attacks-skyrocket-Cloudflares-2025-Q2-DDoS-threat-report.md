### Key DDoS insights

DDoS attacks continue to break records. During 2025 Q2, Cloudflare automatically blocked the largest ever reported DDoS attacks, peaking at 7.3 terabits per second (Tbps) and 4.8 billion packets per second (Bpps).

Overall, in 2025 Q2, hyper-volumetric DDoS attacks skyrocketed. Cloudflare blocked over 6,500 hyper-volumetric DDoS attacks, an average of 71 per day.

Although the overall number of DDoS attacks dropped compared to the previous quarter — which saw an unprecedented surge driven by a large-scale campaign targeting Cloudflare’s network and critical Internet infrastructure protected by Cloudflare — the number of attacks in 2025 Q2 were still 44% higher than in 2024 Q2. Critical infrastructure continues to face sustained pressure, with the Telecommunications, Service Providers, and Carriers sector jumping again to the top as the most targeted industry.
