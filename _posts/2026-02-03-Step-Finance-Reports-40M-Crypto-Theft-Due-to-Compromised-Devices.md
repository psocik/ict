## Step Finance Suffers Major Breach 🚨

Step Finance has announced a staggering loss of **$40 million** in digital assets following a breach that compromised the devices of its executive team. The incident was detected on **January 31**, prompting immediate action from cybersecurity researchers who assisted in recovering some of the stolen assets.

### Details of the Incident

According to blockchain analytics firm CertiK, the stolen amount was initially reported as **261,854 SOL**, valued at approximately **$28.9 million**. However, further investigation by Step Finance confirmed the total losses to be around **$40 million**. So far, about **$3.7 million** in Remora assets and **$1 million** in other positions have been recovered, thanks to the protections offered by Token22 and partner coordination.
