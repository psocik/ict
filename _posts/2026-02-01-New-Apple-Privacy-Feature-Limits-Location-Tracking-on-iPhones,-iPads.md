Apple is introducing a new privacy feature that lets users limit the precision of location data shared with cellular networks on some iPhone and iPad models. The "Limit Precise Location" setting will be available after upgrading to iOS 26.3 or later, and it works by restricting the information mobile carriers use to determine device locations via cell tower connections. When enabled, cellular networks can only identify the device's approximate location, such as a neighborhood, rather than a precise street address.

According to Apple, "The limit precise location setting doesn't impact the precision of the location data that is shared with emergency responders during an emergency call." Apple also stated, "This setting affects only the location data available to cellular networks. It doesn't impact the location data that you share with apps through Location Services. For example, it has no impact on sharing your location with friends and family with Find My."

Users can enable the feature by opening "Settings," tapping "Cellular," then "Cellular Data Options," and toggling the "Limit Precise Location" setting. After enabling limited precise location, the system may prompt a device restart to complete activation. The privacy enhancement feature currently works only on iPhone Air, iPhone 16e, and iPad Pro (M5) Wi-Fi + Cellular models running iOS 26.3 or later. Availability depends on carrier support, and currently supported mobile networks include Telekom in Germany, EE and BT in the United Kingdom, Boost Mobile in the United States, and AIS and True in Thailand.

While Apple has yet to share why it's introducing this feature, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) fined the largest U.S. wireless carriers almost $200 million in April 2024. The list of fines includes $80 million for T-Mobile and $12 million for Sprint (which have since merged), more than $57 million for AT&T, and nearly $47 million for Verizon. Since cellular networks can easily track device locations via tower connections for network operations, Apple's new privacy feature (currently supported by only a small number of networks) is a big step towards ensuring that carriers can collect only limited data on their customers' movements and habits.
