Nike, the American apparel behemoth, may have suffered a data breach. A prominent cybercriminal gang claims it has hacked the company and is threatening to release stolen data to the public. The World Leaks gang posted Nike on its dark web leak site, used to showcase its latest victims. This is a common tactic ransomware gangs employ, hoping to coax victims into meeting their ransom demand over fears of public exposure.

At the time of this writing, attackers were scant on details. They did not disclose how much data may have been syphoned or provide any data samples to support the Nike data breach claims. The post claiming Nike as a victim includes a countdown clock set to end on January 24th. Ransomware gangs use this tool to create a sense of urgency and as a scare tactic against victim organizations.

The World Leaks gang was launched in early 2025 and is widely believed to be a rebrand of the notorious Hunter’s International ransomware cartel. The gang departed somewhat from typical ransomware practices by threatening to leak stolen data rather than encrypting files on target systems. However, according to researchers at Halycon, that gang combines traditional encryption with data leaks and functions as an extortion-as-a-service (EaaS) operation. Since there is significant overlap between Hunter’s International and World Leaks, the gang is very likely to be Russia-linked.

While the gang victimized numerous organizations over the last year, some of its activities lack credibility. For example, last July, the gang bragged about breaching US tech giant Dell, infiltrating its Customer Solution Centers platform. Meanwhile, the company acknowledged a data breach but added that the data attackers took was useless, as World Leaks accessed an environment designed to demonstrate our products and test proofs-of-concept for Dell’s commercial customers.
