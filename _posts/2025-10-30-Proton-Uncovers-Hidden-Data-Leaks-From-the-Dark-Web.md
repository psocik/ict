Proton has launched the Data Breach Observatory to serve as a reporting platform that monitors and publishes data breaches found on the dark web. Unlike reports that rely on voluntary disclosures, this one pulls information from the same underground sources where hackers trade stolen data. Proton says it uncovered 794 breaches so far this year, which exposed more than 300 million records. The database will update in real time to show how much data is circulating online.

The findings reveal a clear pattern: smaller businesses are being hit the hardest. Companies with fewer than 250 employees account for the majority of the breaches, with retail, tech, and entertainment firms among those targeted.
