Cisco Talos has observed exploitation of CVE-2025-0994, a remote-code-execution vulnerability in Cityworks, a popular asset management system.

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and Trimble have both released advisories pertaining to this vulnerability, with Trimble’s advisory specifically listing indicators of compromise (IOCs) related to the intrusion exploiting the CVE.

IOCs pertaining to intrusions discovered by Talos that involve the exploitation of CVE-2025-0994 overlap with those listed in Trimble’s advisory.

Talos clusters this set of intrusions, exploiting CVE-2025-0944, under the “UAT-6382” umbrella of activity. Based on tooling and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by the threat actor, Talos assesses with high confidence that the exploitation and subsequent post-compromise activity is carried out by Chinese-speaking threat actors.

Post-compromise activity involves the rapid deployment of web shells such as AntSword and chinatso/Chopper on the underlying IIS web servers. UAT-6382 also employed the use of Rust-based loaders to deploy Cobalt Strike and VSHell malware to maintain long-term persistent access.

We track the Rust-based loaders as “TetraLoader,” built using a recently publicly available malware building framework called “MaLoader.” MaLoader, written in Simplified Chinese, allows its operators to wrap shellcode and other payloads into a Rust-based binary, resulting in the creation of TetraLoader.
