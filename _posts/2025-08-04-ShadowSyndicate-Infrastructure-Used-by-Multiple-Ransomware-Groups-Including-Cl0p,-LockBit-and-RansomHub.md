Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered significant overlaps between the attack infrastructure of ShadowSyndicate, also known as Infra Storm by Group-IB, and several prominent ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operations.

Active since July 2022, ShadowSyndicate has been linked to high-profile RaaS brands such as AlphaV/BlackCat, LockBit, Play, Royal, Cl0p, Cactus, and RansomHub.

The group, speculated to function more as a RaaS affiliate than a pure initial access broker (IAB), shares tactical, technical, and procedural (TTP) similarities with intrusion sets like TrickBot, Ryuk/Conti, FIN7, and TrueBot (Silence.Downloader), which are associated with Russian cyberespionage actors like Evil Corp, potentially directed by the FSB for operations against NATO allies.
