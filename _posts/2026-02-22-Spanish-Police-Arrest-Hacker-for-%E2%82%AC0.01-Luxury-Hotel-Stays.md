## Spanish Police Arrest Hacker for €0.01 Luxury Hotel Stays 🚓

Spanish police have made a significant arrest, apprehending a 20-year-old man in Madrid who allegedly manipulated the online payment system of a travel and hotel booking website. This clever scheme allowed him to secure luxury hotel stays for just **€0.01** per reservation, despite the rooms costing up to **€1,000** per night! 💸

The investigation began on **February 2** after a travel agency reported suspicious bookings. The suspect sabotaged the integrated payment gateway, launching a tailored cyberattack to alter the transaction validation process. As a result, the system authorized reservations as fully paid, while only one cent per booking was actually transferred. 

The fraud was uncovered when the hotel company received the minimal payments, revealing losses of about **€20,000**. The police identified the suspect within just four days and arrested him while he was enjoying his stay at a luxury hotel in Madrid, where he had booked four nights at **€1,000** per night and even consumed minibar items! 🍾

He has been brought before judicial authorities on suspicion of computer fraud, and the investigation is still ongoing.
