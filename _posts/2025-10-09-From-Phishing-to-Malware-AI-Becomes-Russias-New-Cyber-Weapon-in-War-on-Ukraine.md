Russian hackers' adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in cyber attacks against Ukraine has reached a new level in the first half of 2025 (H1 2025), the country's State Service for Special Communications and Information Protection (SSSCIP) said. 

"Hackers now employ it not only to generate phishing messages, but some of the malware samples we have analyzed show clear signs of being generated with AI â€“ and attackers are certainly not going to stop there," the agency said in a report published Wednesday.

One notable attack observed involved UAC-0219's use of malware called WRECKSTEEL in attacks aimed at state administration bodies and critical infrastructure facilities in the country. There is evidence to suggest that the PowerShell data-stealing malware was developed using AI tools.

SSSCIP said it also observed the Russia-linked APT28 (aka UAC-0001) actors weaponizing cross-site scripting flaws in Roundcube and Zimbra webmail software to conduct zero-click attacks.

"When exploiting such vulnerabilities, attackers typically injected malicious code that, through the Roundcube or Zimbra API, gained access to credentials, contact lists, and configured filters to forward all emails to attacker-controlled mailboxes," SSSCIP said. "Another method of stealing credentials using these vulnerabilities was to create hidden HTML blocks (visibility: hidden) with login and password input fields, where the attribute autocomplete='on' was set. This allowed the fields to be auto-filled with data stored in the browser, which was then exfiltrated."
