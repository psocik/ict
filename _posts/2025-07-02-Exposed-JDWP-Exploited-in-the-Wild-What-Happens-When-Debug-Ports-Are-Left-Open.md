During routine monitoring, the Wiz Research Team observed an exploitation attempt targeting one of our honeypot servers running TeamCity, a popular CI/CD tool. Our investigation determined that the attacker had gained remote code execution by abusing an exposed Java Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP) interface, ultimately deploying a cryptomining payload and setting up multiple persistence mechanisms.

We found this attack interesting due to a few key points:

- **Fast Exploitation:** Malware was deployed within just a few hours of exposing the vulnerable machine. We observed this rapid turnaround across multiple attempts.
- **Customized XMRig payload:** The attacker used a modified version of XMRig with a hardcoded configuration, allowing them to avoid suspicious command-line arguments that are often flagged by defenders.
- **Stealthy crypto-mining:** The payload used mining pool proxies to hide their cryptocurrency wallet address, thereby preventing investigators from pivoting on it.
