In March–April 2024, during incident response within the information and communication system of a central executive body, Ukraine’s Computer and Emergency Response identified a Windows system infected with BEARDSHELL and SLIMAGENT.

BEARDSHELL and SLIMAGENT are two advanced malware tools written in C++. BEARDSHELL downloads, decrypts (using ChaCha20-Poly1305), and runs PowerShell scripts, sending results via the Icedrive API. It creates a unique folder on each infected machine based on system identifiers. SLIMAGENT captures screenshots using Windows APIs, encrypts them with AES and RSA, and stores them locally with timestamped filenames. Both tools are stealthy, use strong encryption, and exploit legitimate cloud services to avoid detection, highlighting modern APT tactics.

In May 2025, ESET researchers reported unauthorized access to an email account in the Ukrainian government’s gov.ua domain. CERT-UA, in collaboration with the Cybersecurity Center of Military Unit A0334, responded to the incident.

During forensic analysis, the researchers discovered malware linked to the COVENANT framework and the BEARDSHELL backdoor. The experts were not able to determine the initial infection vector.
