Polish authorities have apprehended three Ukrainian nationals on suspicion of attempting to compromise critical IT systems and acquire sensitive national defense data within the country. The men, aged between 39 and 43, were reportedly "visibly nervous" when stopped by officers, claiming they were en route to Lithuania. Police subsequently arrested them, and they now face charges including fraud, computer fraud, and possession of devices and software intended for criminal activity, following their inability to provide a plausible explanation for the electronic equipment in their possession. The arrests highlight a direct threat to strategic infrastructure, prompting a thorough investigation by Polish law enforcement.

During a vehicle search, officers discovered a cache of sophisticated equipment described as capable of "interfering with the country's strategic IT systems, breaking into IT and telecommunications networks." Seized items included "advanced FLIPPER hacking equipment," a spy device detector, various antennas, laptops, a large number of SIM cards, routers, portable hard drives, and cameras. This arsenal suggests a capability to conduct both offensive cyber operations and counter-surveillance, raising significant concerns about the scope and intent of their activities against national infrastructure.

A key piece of evidence, the Flipper Zero device, is a portable tool widely known for pentesting and hardware hacking. It can interact with a range of radio frequencies, capture data, or jam radio communication. Its capabilities extend to reading and emulating RDIF, NFC, and Bluetooth signals, as well as emulating input devices like keyboards and mice to execute scripts. This device, due to its extensive capabilities and relatively low cost, has seen increased adoption for malicious purposes and has been subject to bans in several countries. Another confiscated item, a K19 RF/GS detection tool, is designed to locate hidden surveillance equipment by detecting wireless signals, GPS trackers, hidden cameras, and strong magnetic fields, indicating a comprehensive approach to either intelligence gathering or avoiding detection.

The arrested individuals, who claimed to be IT specialists, reportedly feigned ignorance when questioned about the seized equipment, underscoring their likely intent to conceal their true activities. Although data on their storage devices was encrypted, officers from Poland’s Central Bureau for Combating Cybercrime (CBZC) have successfully collected evidence. Authorities are exploring multiple scenarios regarding the men's presence and intentions in Poland, emphasizing the ongoing nature of this significant national security investigation. The immediate detention of the suspects for three months pending trial underscores the gravity with which these alleged attempts to compromise national defense IT systems are being treated.
