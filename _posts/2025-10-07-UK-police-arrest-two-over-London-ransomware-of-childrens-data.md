The gang, which identifies itself as Radiant, reported on the attack on its dark web portal last month. It evidenced its claim by publishing the names, photos, home addresses, and family contact information of 10 children it said attended one of Kido's centres.

London's Metropolitan Police said the two men, aged 17 and 22, were arrested and taken into custody, where they will remain for questioning. The arrests followed an operation at several residential properties in the town of Bishop's Stortford.
