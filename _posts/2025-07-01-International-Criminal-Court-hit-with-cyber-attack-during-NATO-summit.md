The International Criminal Court has been targeted by a “sophisticated” cyberattack and is taking measures to limit any damage.

The ICC said the incident, which happened last week during the NATO leaders' summit, had been contained but did not elaborate further on the impact or possible motive.

“A Court-wide impact analysis is being carried out, and steps are already being taken to mitigate any effects of the incident,” the court said in a statement.

The court declined to say whether any confidential information had been compromised.

The ICC was a target of a cyberattack in 2023 and it still does not have wifi completely restored to its purpose-built headquarters because of it.
