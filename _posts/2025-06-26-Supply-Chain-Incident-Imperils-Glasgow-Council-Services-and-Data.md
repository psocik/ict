A security incident at a fourth-party supplier earlier this month has led to online service disruption and potential customer data theft, Glasgow City Council has warned.

On June 19, the councilâ€™s IT supplier CGI discovered malicious activity on servers managed by one of its own suppliers. The council said it has isolated any potentially impacted servers as a result, leading to the disruption of digital services for locals.

This includes viewing and commenting on planning applications; paying penalty charges for parking or bus lane contraventions; reporting school absences, and ordering certificates from city registrars.
