A major Mexican drug cartel insider grassed on his fellow drug-peddlers back in 2018, telling the FBI that a cartel "hacker" was tracking a federal official and using their deep-rooted access to the country's critical infrastructure to kill informants.  

The revelation was made in a new audit of the work the FBI is doing to protect its investigations from technological surveillance. 

According to the newly published report, the Sinaloa cartel/El Chapo insider contacted the FBI in 2018 and told it of all the ways in which the cybercrook hired by the cartel helped it track down those who could give up key details about its operation.
