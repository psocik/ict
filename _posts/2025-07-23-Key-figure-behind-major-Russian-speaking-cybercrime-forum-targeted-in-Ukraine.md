A long-running investigation led by the French Police and Paris Prosecutor, in close cooperation with their Ukrainian counterpart and Europol, has led to the arrest of the suspected administrator of xss.is, one of the worldâ€™s most influential Russian-speaking cybercrime platforms.

The forum, which had more than 50,000 registered users, served as a key marketplace for stolen data, hacking tools, and illicit services. It has long been a central platform for some of the most active and dangerous cybercriminal networks, used to coordinate, advertise and recruit.
