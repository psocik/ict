Russian cybercrime group Lynx breached Dodd Group, a contractor for the UK Ministry of Defence, stealing and leaking hundreds of sensitive files on eight RAF and Royal Navy bases. The incident occurred on 23 September, with The Daily Mail labeling the attack as “catastrophic.”

Compromised data includes staff names and emails, contractors’ names, phone numbers, car details, and MoD staff contacts, with some documents labeled “Controlled” or “Official Sensitive.”

Leaked MoD documents reveal sensitive details on RAF and Navy bases, including Lakenheath (hosting US F-35 jets), Portreath (NATO radar site), and Predannack (UK Drone Hub), as per The Daily Mail.

Leaked files include around 1,000 documents: visitor logs for RAF Portreath and RNAS Culdrose, internal emails and security guidance, plus construction records for RAF Lakenheath and RAF Mildenhall, revealing sensitive operational details.
