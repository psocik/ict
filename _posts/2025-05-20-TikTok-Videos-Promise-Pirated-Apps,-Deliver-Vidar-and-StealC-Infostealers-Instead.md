Trend Research uncovered a new social engineering campaign using TikTok to deliver the Vidar and StealC information stealers. This attack uses videos (possibly AI-generated) to instruct users to execute PowerShell commands, which are disguised as software activation steps.

TikTok’s algorithmic reach increases the likelihood of widespread exposure, with one video reaching more than half a million views. Businesses can be affected by data exfiltration, credential theft, and potential compromise of sensitive systems as a result of this threat.

Reinforcing security awareness, especially against AI-generated content, is crucial. Monitoring for unusual command execution involving PowerShell or other system utilities also helps identify malicious activity early.
