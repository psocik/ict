**Executive Summary**

In March 2025, Unit 42 researchers identified a wave of Prometei attacks. Prometei refers to both the botnet and the malware family used to operate it.

This malware family, which includes both Linux and Windows variants, allows attackers to remotely control compromised systems for cryptocurrency mining (particularly Monero) and credential theft. This article focuses on the resurgence of the Linux variant.

Prometei is under active development, incorporating new modules and methods into its capabilities. The latest Prometei versions feature a backdoor that enables a variety of malicious activities. Threat actors employ a domain generation algorithm (DGA) for their command-and-control (C2) infrastructure and integrate self-updating features for stealth and evasion.

This article presents a static analysis of Prometei malware versions three and four, highlighting key functional differences from version two.
