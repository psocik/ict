## European Commission Investigates Cyberattack 🚨

The European Commission is currently investigating a **cyberattack** that compromised its mobile device management system. On **January 30**, signs of the attack were detected, indicating that attackers may have accessed sensitive staff data, including names and phone numbers. However, no devices have been compromised.

The advisory states: 
> "On January 30, the European Commission’s central infrastructure managing mobile devices identified traces of a cyber-attack, which may have resulted in access to staff names and mobile numbers of some of its staff members."

Thanks to the Commission's swift response, the incident was contained and the system was cleaned within **9 hours**. They continue to monitor security, strengthen cybersecurity measures, and review the incident to enhance protections against ongoing cyber threats to critical services and institutions. 

The **European Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-EU)** is currently investigating the security breach. 

### Potential Risks ⚠️
Attackers could exploit the stolen data to launch targeted **vishing** and **phishing** attacks by impersonating colleagues or officials to steal credentials. This data could also facilitate reconnaissance for spear phishing or physical targeting of key personnel. Furthermore, potential **GDPR violations** and reputational damage could undermine the Union’s cyber credibility.

In **April 2021**, a spokesperson for the European Commission confirmed that the organization, along with other EU institutions, was affected by a cyberattack in March. This incident was described as more severe than typical attacks on the EU.
