Cybersecurity researchers disclosed two vulnerabilities in the Sudo command-line utility for Linux and Unix-like operating systems. Local attackers can exploit the vulnerabilities to escalate privileges to root on affected systems.

Sudo (short for “superuser do”) is a command-line utility found in Unix and Linux systems. It lets a permitted user run commands with the security privileges of another user, most commonly the root user (the system’s most powerful administrative account).

Below is the description of the two vulnerabilities:

- **CVE-2025-32462** (CVSS score: 2.8) – Sudo before 1.9.17p1, when used with a sudoers file that specifies a host that is neither the current host nor ALL, allows listed users to execute commands on unintended machines.
- **CVE-2025-32463** (CVSS score: 9.3) – Sudo before 1.9.17p1 allows local users to obtain root access because /etc/nsswitch.conf from a user-controlled directory is used with the –chroot option.

The Stratascale Cyber Research Unit (CRU) team discovered both local privilege vulnerabilities.
