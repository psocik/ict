**Executive Summary**

SentinelLABS and Beazley Security discovered and analyzed a rapidly evolving series of infostealer campaigns delivering the Python-based PXA Stealer.

This discovery showcases a leap in tradecraft, incorporating more nuanced anti-analysis techniques, non-malicious decoy content, and a hardened command-and-control pipeline that frustrates triage and attempts to delay detection.

We identified more than 4,000 unique victim IP addresses in exfiltrated logs, with infected systems spanning at least 62 countries, most notably South Korea, the United States, the Netherlands, Hungary, and Austria.

The stolen data includes over 200,000 unique passwords, hundreds of credit card records, and more than 4 million harvested browser cookies, giving actors ample access to victims’ accounts and financial lives.

The threat actors behind these campaigns are linked to Vietnamese-speaking cybercriminal circles who monetize the stolen data through a subscription-based underground ecosystem that efficiently automates resale and reuse through the Telegram platform’s API.
