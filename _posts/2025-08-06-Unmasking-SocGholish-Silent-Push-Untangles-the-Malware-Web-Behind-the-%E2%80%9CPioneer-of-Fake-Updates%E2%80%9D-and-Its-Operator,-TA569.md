**Key Findings**  
SocGholish, operated by TA569, actually functions as a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) vendor, selling access to compromised systems to various financially motivated cybercriminal clients.  
The primary tactic used involves deceptive “fake browser update” lures, often initiated by JavaScript injections on compromised websites, which lead to drive-by malware downloads.  
SocGholish leverages Traffic Distribution Systems (TDSs) like Parrot TDS and Keitaro TDS (the latter notably used in Russian disinformation campaigns) to filter and redirect victims to malicious content.  
Thus, TA569 acts as a vendor, or an Initial Access Broker (IAB), enabling other notorious groups and even the Russian GRU’s Unit 29155 (via Raspberry Robin) to conduct follow-on attacks, including ransomware deployments.  
SocGholish also utilizes domain shadowing and rotates its active domains frequently in order to evade detection, making proactive threat intelligence crucial for a reliable defense.
