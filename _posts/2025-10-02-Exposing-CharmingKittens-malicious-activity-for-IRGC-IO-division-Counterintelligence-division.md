Today, we begin exposing the Iranian APT affiliated with the Counterintelligence Division (Unit 1500) of the IRGC-IO, known as Charming Kitten.

Heading this operation is Abbas Rahrovi (aka Abbas Hosseini, National Number: 4270844116), an IRGC official who has established several front companies in recent years through which he manages the APT. Over the years, he directed attacks against dozens of targets including:

- Telecommunications companies  
- Aviation companies  
- Intelligence organizations  

The primary focus of this APT is on countries in the Middle East and Gulf region, including Turkey, UAE, Qatar, Afghanistan, Israel, Jordan and others.

Every few days, we will release more evidence about their activities, along with additional information about their personal lives.
