An Oregon man was charged by a federal criminal complaint today in the District of Alaska on charges related to his alleged development and administration of the “Rapper Bot” DDoS-for-hire Botnet that has conducted large-scale cyber-attacks since at least 2021.

According to court documents, investigators identified Ethan Foltz, 22, of Eugene, Oregon, as the alleged administrator of Rapper Bot. Rapper Bot, aka “Eleven Eleven Botnet” and “CowBot,” primarily compromises devices like Digital Video Recorders (DVRs) or WiFi routers at scale by infecting those devices with specialized malware.

The criminal complaint details that partner data shows from April 2025 to present, Rapper Bot allegedly conducted over 370,000 attacks, targeting 18,000 unique victims. It is alleged that Rapper Bot was utilizing roughly 65,000 to 95,000 infected victim devices to regularly conduct DDoS attacks that commonly averaged between two to three Terabits per second, with the largest attack potentially exceeding six Terabits per second. A DDoS attack averaging over two Terabits per second lasting 30 seconds might cost a victim anywhere from $500 to $10,000.
