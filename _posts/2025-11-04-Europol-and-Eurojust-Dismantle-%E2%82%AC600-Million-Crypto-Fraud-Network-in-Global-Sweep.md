Nine people have been arrested in connection with a coordinated law enforcement operation that targeted a cryptocurrency money laundering network that defrauded victims of €600 million (~88 million).

The members of the network created dozens of fake cryptocurrency investment platforms that looked like legitimate websites and promised high returns. They recruited their victims using a variety of methods such as social media advertising, cold calling, fake news articles, and fake testimonials from celebrities or successful investors.

Once victims invested their funds in the bogus platforms, the crypto assets were laundered using blockchain, netting them about €600 million in illicit revenue.

The disclosure comes as Europol revealed that the criminal use of cryptocurrency and blockchain is becoming increasingly professionalized, sophisticated, and organized, and that countering the "borderless nature" of the threat requires a similar response.
