Authorities arrested 260 cybercrime suspects during a two-week operation spanning 14 African countries, Interpol announced Friday. The globally coordinated summertime crackdown dubbed “Operation Contender 3.0” targeted criminal networks that facilitated romance scams and sextortion, officials said.

Authorities in Ghana arrested 68 people, seized 835 devices and identified 108 victims who lost a combined $450,000, $70,000 of which was recovered. The suspects allegedly used fake profiles, forged identities and stolen images to deceive victims using multiple schemes, including fake courier and customs shipment fees, and sextortion for blackmail.

Police in Senegal arrested 22 suspects who allegedly defrauded 120 victims on social media and dating platforms of about $34,000 combined.  

In Cote d’Ivoire, police arrested 24 suspects and identified 809 victims who were allegedly manipulated to share intimate images before they were blackmailed. Angola authorities arrested eight people for allegedly scamming 28 domestic and international victims via social media.

Group-IB and Trend Micro assisted in the investigation, and other countries participating in the effort included Benin, Burkina Faso, Gambia, Guinea, Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Uganda and Zambia.
