# Cybercriminals Attack Seychelles – Offshore Banking as a Target

**Source:** Resecurity  
**Date Published:** July 29, 2025  

Resecurity identified an increase in attacks against offshore banking platforms. The motives behind this activity may not be traditional cybercrime but rather intelligence collection, as some countries in offshore zones are known to be uncooperative and heavily involved in tax evasion schemes and processing funds received from fraudulent operations.

A hacker claims to have stolen and sold the personal data of clients from Seychelles Commercial Bank (SCB). The bank, which provides personal and corporate services on Seychelles, one of the world's smallest countries, notified customers of a hack, but said only personal information - not money - was stolen.

In reporting by OCCRP, the Central Bank of Seychelles confirmed that it has been formally notified by the Seychelles Commercial Bank of its recent cybersecurity incident.

The archipelago nation in the Indian Ocean, located northeast of Madagascar, has 98,000 inhabitants, ranks as the richest country in Africa, and has a reputation for being a tax haven.
