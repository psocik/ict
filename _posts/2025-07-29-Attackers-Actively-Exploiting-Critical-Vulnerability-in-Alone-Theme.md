On May 30th, 2025, we received a submission for an Arbitrary File Upload via Plugin Installation vulnerability in Alone, a WordPress theme with more than 9,000 sales. This vulnerability makes it possible for an unauthenticated attacker to upload arbitrary files to a vulnerable site and achieve remote code execution, which is typically leveraged for a complete site takeover. The vendor released the patched version on June 16th, 2025, and we publicly disclosed this vulnerability on July 14th, 2025. Our records indicate that attackers started exploiting the issue on July 12th, 2025, before we disclosed the vulnerability. The Wordfence Firewall has already blocked over 120,900 exploit attempts targeting this vulnerability.

Wordfence Premium, Wordfence Care, and Wordfence Response users received a firewall rule to protect against any exploits targeting this vulnerability on May 30, 2025. Sites using the free version of Wordfence received the same protection after the standard 30-day delay on June 29, 2025.

We urge users to ensure their sites are updated with the latest patched version of Alone, version 7.8.5 at the time of this writing, as soon as possible, as this vulnerability is under active exploitation.
