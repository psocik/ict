MAG Aerospace, military contractor for the US military in intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, suffered a breach exposing its employee data.  
According to MAG Aerospace, the company was alerted about suspicious activity within its network in late August of 2025. To quarantine the issue, the Fairfax-based military contractor disabled affected accounts to prevent the breach from impacting more of its systems.  
“We also took measures to contain the incident, including quarantining assets, disabling affected accounts and domains, blocking access to our network, resetting passwords for affected accounts, and contacting law enforcement,” the company’s breach notice reads.  
Given the sensitive nature of the industry MAG Aerospace operates in, the data could be a goldmine for threat actors and nation state attackers. To the very least, personal data theft enables attackers to conduct convincing phishing and social engineering attacks which may lead to victims inadvertently installing malware on their devices.
