New research from Checkmarx Zero has unveiled a unique malicious software campaign that targets Python and NPM users on both Windows and Linux systems.

Security researcher Ariel Harush at Checkmarx Zero has identified this troubling new trend in cyberattacks. According to their research, shared with Hackread.com, attackers are using typosquatting and name-confusion techniques to trick users into downloading harmful software.

What makes this campaign especially unusual is its cross-ecosystem approach. The malicious packages, uploaded to PyPI (Python Package Index), mimic the names of legitimate software from two different programming ecosystems: colorama (a popular Python tool for adding color to text in terminals) and colorizr (a similar JavaScript package found on NPM, the Node Package Manager). This means an attacker is using a name from one platform to target users of another, a rarely seen tactic.
