Security outfit Huntress has been forced onto the defensive after its latest research – described by senior staff as "hilarious" – split opinion across the cybersecurity community.

Defenders, for the most part, agreed with the vendor's assessment of the situation, which revolved around an attacker, for whatever reason, installing a trial version of its EDR tool and consequently having their entire activity monitored by the good guys.

"We wanted to serve the broader community by sharing what we learned about the tradecraft that the threat actor was using in this incident," Huntress stated.

"In deciding what information to publish about this investigation, we carefully considered several factors, like strictly upholding our privacy obligations, as well as disseminating EDR telemetry that specifically reflected threats and behavior that could help defenders.

Overall, this investigation is a result of what we strive to do best: Transparency, education, and wrecking hackers."
