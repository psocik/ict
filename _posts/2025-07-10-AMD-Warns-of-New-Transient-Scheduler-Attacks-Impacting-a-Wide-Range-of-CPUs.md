Semiconductor company AMD is warning of a new set of vulnerabilities affecting a broad range of chipsets that could lead to information disclosure.

The flaws, collectively called Transient Scheduler Attacks (TSA), manifest in the form of a speculative side channel in its CPUs that leverage execution timing of instructions under specific microarchitectural conditions.

"In some cases, an attacker may be able to use this timing information to infer data from other contexts, resulting in information leakage," AMD said in an advisory.

The company said issues were uncovered as part of a study published by Microsoft and ETH Zurich researchers about testing modern CPUs against speculative execution attacks like Meltdown and Foreshadow by stress testing isolation between security domains such as virtual machines, kernel, and processes.
