The Canadian Centre for Cyber Security and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have issued an advisory warning of cyber attacks mounted by the China-linked Salt Typhoon actors to breach major global telecommunications providers as part of a cyber espionage campaign.

The attackers exploited a critical Cisco IOS XE software (CVE-2023-20198, CVSS score: 10.0) to access configuration files from three network devices registered to a Canadian telecommunications company in mid-February 2025.

The threat actors are also said to have modified at least one of the files to configure a Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) tunnel, enabling traffic collection from the network. The name of the targeted company was not disclosed.
