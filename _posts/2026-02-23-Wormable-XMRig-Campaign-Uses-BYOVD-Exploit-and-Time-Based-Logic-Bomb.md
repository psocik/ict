## Wormable XMRig Campaign Uses BYOVD Exploit and Time-Based Logic Bomb 🚨

Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a new cryptojacking campaign that uses pirated software bundles as lures to deploy a bespoke XMRig miner program on compromised hosts. **Analysis of the recovered dropper, persistence triggers, and mining payload reveals a sophisticated, multi-stage infection prioritizing maximum cryptocurrency mining hashrate, often destabilizing the victim system.**

Furthermore, the malware exhibits worm-like capabilities, spreading across external storage devices, enabling lateral movement even in air-gapped environments. The entry point of the attack is the use of social engineering decoys, advertising free premium software in the form of pirated software bundles, such as installers for office productivity suites, to trick unsuspecting users into downloading malware-laced executables.

Present within the malware is a logic bomb that operates by retrieving the local system time and comparing it against a predefined timestamp. If it's before December 23, 2025, the malware proceeds with installing the persistence modules and launching the miner. If it's after December 23, 2025, the binary is launched with the "barusu" argument, resulting in a "controlled decommissioning" of the infection. The hard deadline of December 23, 2025, indicates that the campaign was designed to run indefinitely on compromised systems, with the date likely either signaling the expiration of rented command-and-control (C2) infrastructure, a predicted shift in the cryptocurrency market, or a planned move to a new malware variant.

Also dropped are files to ensure persistence, terminate security tools, and execute the miner with elevated privileges by using a legitimate but flawed driver (**WinRing0x64.sys**) as part of a technique called bring your own vulnerable driver (BYOVD). The driver is susceptible to a vulnerability tracked as CVE-2020-14979 (CVSS score: 7.8) that allows privilege escalation. The integration of this exploit into the XMRig miner is to have greater control over the CPU's low-level configuration and boost the mining performance (i.e., the RandomX hashrate) by 15% to 50%.

A distinguishing feature of this XMRig variant is its aggressive propagation capability. It does not rely solely on the user downloading the dropper; it actively attempts to spread to other systems via removable media. This transforms the malware from a simple Trojan into a worm. Evidence shows that the mining activity took place, albeit sporadically, throughout November 2025, before spiking on December 8, 2025. **By chaining together social engineering, legitimate software masquerades, worm-like propagation, and kernel-level exploitation, the attackers have created a resilient and highly efficient botnet.**
