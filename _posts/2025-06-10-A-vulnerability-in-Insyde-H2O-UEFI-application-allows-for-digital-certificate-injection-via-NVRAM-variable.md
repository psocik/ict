## Overview
A vulnerability in an Insyde H2O UEFI firmware application allows digital certificate injection through an unprotected NVRAM variable. This issue arises from the unsafe use of an NVRAM variable, which is used as trusted storage for a digital certificate in the trust validation chain. An attacker can store their own certificate in this variable and subsequently run arbitrary firmware (signed by the injected certificate) during the early boot process within the UEFI environment.

## Description
Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) defines a modern firmware architecture that facilitates interaction between a computer’s hardware and its operating system during early boot. When a UEFI-compliant system starts, UEFI applications and drivers are executed to initialize the system and hand off control to the operating system (OS) loader. These UEFI applications must be signed and verified for execution under Secure Boot. These signatures can originate from the OEM or from entries in the system’s signature database (DB), which commonly includes the Microsoft UEFI Certificate Authority (CA).

UEFI defines extensible NVRAM variables that store configuration, device customization, and runtime context shared across UEFI applications and the operating system. A vulnerability was identified in a firmware application due to the use of an untrusted NVRAM variable, SecureFlashCertData, to store and exchange public keys. Because this NVRAM variable is not protected (i.e., not locked), it can be updated at runtime—allowing an attacker to inject their own keys.
