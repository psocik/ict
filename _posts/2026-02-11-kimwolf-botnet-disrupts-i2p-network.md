## Kimwolf Botnet Disrupts I2P Network 🚨

For the past week, the massive **Internet of Things** (IoT) botnet known as **Kimwolf** has been disrupting **The Invisible Internet Project (I2P)**, a decentralized, encrypted communications network designed to anonymize and secure online communications. I2P users started reporting disruptions in the network around the same time the Kimwolf botmasters began relying on it to evade takedown attempts against the botnet’s control servers.

Although Kimwolf is known as a potent weapon for launching **DDoS attacks**, the outages caused this week by some portion of the botnet attempting to join I2P are what’s known as a **“Sybil attack,”** a threat in peer-to-peer networks where a single entity can disrupt the system by creating, controlling, and operating a large number of fake, pseudonymous identities.

The same day that I2P users began noticing the outages, the individuals in control of Kimwolf posted to their **Discord channel** that they had accidentally disrupted I2P after attempting to join **700,000 Kimwolf-infected bots** as nodes on the network.

Brundage said the Kimwolf operator(s) have been trying to build a command and control network that can’t easily be taken down by security companies and network operators that are working together to combat the spread of the botnet. Brundage said the people in control of Kimwolf have been experimenting with using I2P and a similar anonymity network — **Tor** — as a backup command and control network, although there have been no reports of widespread disruptions in the Tor network recently.
