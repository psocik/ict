## Summary  
- The AIVD and MIVD (‘the Dutch services’) have identified a publicly unknown, highly probably Russian state-supported threat actor named **LAUNDRY BEAR**.  
- LAUNDRY BEAR is responsible for conducting various cyber operations against Western government organizations since 2024, specifically targeting armed forces, government organizations, defense contractors, social and cultural organizations, and digital service providers.  
- This investigation was initiated following an opportunistic cyber attack on the Dutch police in September 2024. The attacker obtained work-related contact information of police employees. It is highly probable that other Dutch organizations were also victims of this threat actor.  
- LAUNDRY BEAR has managed to evade detection by employing simple attack methods and vectors using tools readily available on victims’ computers, making them difficult for organizations to distinguish from other known Russian threat actors.
