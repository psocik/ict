Tracked as CVE-2025-21043, this critical security flaw affects Samsung devices running Android 13 or later and was reported by the security teams of Meta and WhatsApp on August 13.

As Samsung explains in a recently updated advisory, this vulnerability was discovered in `libimagecodec.quram.so` (a closed-source image parsing library developed by Quramsoft that implements support for various image formats) and is caused by an out-of-bounds write weakness that allows attackers to execute malicious code on vulnerable devices remotely.

Although Apple and WhatsApp haven't released any details regarding the attacks chaining CVE-2025-55177 and CVE-2025-43300, Donncha Ã“ Cearbhaill (the head of Amnesty International's Security Lab) said that WhatsApp has warned some users that their devices were targeted in an advanced spyware campaign.
