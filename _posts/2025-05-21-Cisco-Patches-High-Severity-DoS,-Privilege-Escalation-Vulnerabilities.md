The ISE bug, tracked as CVE-2025-20152, impacts the RADIUS message processing feature and could be exploited remotely, without authentication, to cause ISE to reload, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition.

“This vulnerability is due to improper handling of certain RADIUS requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specific authentication request to a network access device (NAD) that uses Cisco ISE for authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA),” Cisco notes in its advisory.

The networking giant also resolved a high-severity issue in Unified Intelligence Center, tracked as CVE-2025-20113, that could allow an authenticated attacker to elevate their privileges to those of an administrator, for a limited set of functions on a vulnerable system.
