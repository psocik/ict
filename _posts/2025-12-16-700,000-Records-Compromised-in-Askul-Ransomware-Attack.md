Japanese e-commerce and logistics company Askul has revealed that a recent data breach stemming from a ransomware attack has resulted in over 700,000 records being compromised.

However, prior to the data encryption being initiated, the hackers stole sensitive information from the company’s systems in an effort to increase their chances of getting paid.

The RansomHouse ransomware group took credit for the attack on Askul in late October, leaking data allegedly stolen from its systems on November 10 and December 2. The fact that data has been made public indicates that the company has refused to pay a ransom.

The company’s investigation showed that the cybercriminals gained access to its network using compromised credentials. After obtaining initial access to Askul systems, the attackers conducted reconnaissance, harvested credentials, moved laterally, and disabled security systems. File-encrypting malware was deployed after backup files were deleted, the company said in an incident report written in Japanese.
