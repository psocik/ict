A May 2025 attack on a financial institution in Asia saw the Fog ransomware deployed, alongside an unusual toolset, including some dual-use and open-source pentesting tools we have not observed being used in ransomware attacks previously.

The attackers used a legitimate employee monitoring software called Syteca (formerly Ekran), which is highly unusual and not something we have seen used in a ransomware attack chain before. They also deployed several open-source pentesting tools – GC2, Adaptix, and Stowaway – which are not commonly used during ransomware attacks. 

Also notable in this attack was that, a few days after the ransomware was deployed, the attackers created a service to establish persistence. This is an unusual step to see in a ransomware attack, with malicious activity usually ceasing on a network once the attackers have exfiltrated data and deployed the ransomware, but the attackers in this incident appeared to wish to retain access to the victim’s network.
