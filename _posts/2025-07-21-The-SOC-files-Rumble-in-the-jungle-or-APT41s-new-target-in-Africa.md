## Introduction

Some time ago, Kaspersky MDR analysts detected a targeted attack against government IT services in the African region. The attackers used hardcoded names of internal services, IP addresses, and proxy servers embedded within their malware. One of the C2s was a captive SharePoint server within the victim’s infrastructure.

During our incident analysis, we were able to determine that the threat actor behind the activity was APT41. This is a Chinese-speaking cyberespionage group known for targeting organizations across multiple sectors, including telecom and energy providers, educational institutions, healthcare organizations, and IT energy companies in at least 42 countries. It’s worth noting that, prior to the incident, Africa had experienced the least activity from this APT.
