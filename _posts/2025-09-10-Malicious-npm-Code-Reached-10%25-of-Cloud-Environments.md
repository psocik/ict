During the short two-hour timeframe in which the versions were available for download, if they were incorporated into frontend builds and shipped as web assets, any browsers loading the affected website would execute a malicious payload that hooks network and wallet APIs in order to silently rewrite cryptocurrency recipients/approvals before signing, so that transactions would be diverted to attacker-controlled wallets. Following the release of the malicious versions, our data shows that the malicious code itself could be found in at least 10% of cloud environments, present in bundles or assets. After the initial batch of infected packages, we identified a few more compromised accounts, including duckdb, which indicates that the campaign is still active.
