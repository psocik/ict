Nvidia last week advised customers to ensure they employ mitigations against Rowhammer attacks, after researchers found one of its workstation-grade GPUs is susceptible to the exploit.

Rowhammer is a method of attempting to corrupt memory by repeatedly "hammering" rows of memory cells with a burst of read or write operations. The repeat operations can create electrical interference between rows of memory cells, potentially disrupting operations.

In a July 9 advisory, Nvidia noted that researchers at the University of Toronto recently "demonstrated a successful Rowhammer exploitation on a NVIDIA A6000 GPU with GDDR6 memory where System-Level ECC [error correcting code] was not enabled."
