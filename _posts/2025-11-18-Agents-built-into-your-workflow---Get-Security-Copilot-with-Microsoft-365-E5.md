Microsoft is expanding its agent portfolio, adding to the existing 37 Security Copilot agents with over 40 new Microsoft and partner-built agents. Twelve new Microsoft-built agents across Microsoft Defender, Entra, Intune, and Purview are immediately available in preview. Over 30 new partner-built agents extend protection end-to-end. These agents are designed to automate large-scale tasks, freeing security teams to focus on more strategic initiatives. Security operations teams can leverage agents for real-time alert triage and natural language threat hunting, while identity and access admins can deploy agents in Microsoft Entra to remediate risky users and optimize Conditional Access policies. Data security professionals can use agents in Microsoft Purview to strengthen data security and IT admins can use the new agents in Microsoft Intune to make complex tasks easier.

The interactive agent experience, now in public preview, enables security teams to engage in focused chats tailored to each agent’s expertise. Dynamic workflows and built-in starter prompts keep investigations on track, with real-time prompt suggestions facilitating collaboration between humans and agents. Security Copilot utilizes Microsoft’s threat intelligence, processing over 100 trillion signals daily, and integrates insights through Microsoft Sentinel. Enterprise knowledge integration allows agents to reason over an organization’s internal data, delivering tailored recommendations.

Early results demonstrate the potential of these agents. SOC analysts have detected malicious emails up to 550% faster using the Phishing Triage Agent in Microsoft Defender. Identity admins have achieved up to 204% greater accuracy in identifying missing Zero Trust policies with the Conditional Access Optimization Agent in Microsoft Entra.

Eligible Microsoft 365 E5 customers receive 400 Security Compute Units (SCUs) per month for every 1,000 user licenses, up to 10,000 SCUs per month, intended to support typical scenarios. Customers will have the option to pay for scaling beyond the allocated amount at a future date with $6 per SCU on a pay-as-you-go basis, and will get a 30-day advanced notification when this option is available.
