It’s 2025, and at this point, we’re convinced there’s a secret industry-wide pledge: every network appliance must include at least one trivially avoidable HTTP header parsing bug - preferably pre-auth. Bonus points if it involves sscanf.

If that’s the case, well done! SonicWall’s SMA100 series has proudly fulfilled the quota - possibly even qualified for a bonus.

Our initial journey started with analyzing SonicWall N-days that were receiving coveted attention from our friendly APT groups. But somewhere along the way - deep in a fog of malformed headers and reverse proxy shenanigans - we stumbled across vulnerabilities that feel like they were preserved in amber from a more naïve era of C programming.

While we understand (and agree) that these vulnerabilities are ultimately difficult - or in some cases, currently not exploitable - the fact they exist at all is, frankly, disappointing. Pre-auth stack and heap overflows triggered by malformed HTTP headers aren’t supposed to happen anymore. And yet… here we are.

So come, cry with us. We’ll walk you through how we got here, what we found, and why cyber security feels like great job security.
