Nesreen Dalhy B.S. ’23, M.S. ’25 worked with Dr. Karim Elish, associate professor of computer science at Florida Poly, to identify new, more effective ways to detect this malicious software as part of her master’s thesis.

> “RATs are a significant cybersecurity threat – they are particularly hard to detect, remain persistent and attempt to steal as much of your data as possible,” said Dalhy, who has bachelor’s and master’s degrees in computer science from the University. “A lot of the existing research tries to identify general types of malware, but there isn’t much that specifically tries to detect RATs.”

Dalhy, from Davenport, Florida, said RATs have been a problem for years, evolving alongside technology. They continually find new ways to stay hidden in smartphones and steal users’ personal information. Androids account for over 80% of the world’s mobile devices.
