**Key Takeaways**  
*Clickfix abuses trust*: The campaign bypasses malware downloads by using fake security prompts to trick users into running terminal commands.  
*AppleScript payloads steal user data*: The script targets browser profiles, crypto wallets, documents, and system files, then uploads them to attacker-controlled servers.  
*Phishing domains are visually convincing*: Pages like cryptoinfo-news.com mimic CAPTCHAs and verification steps to appear legitimate.  
*C2 infrastructure reveals patterns*: The attackers use SSH, HTTP, and obscure ports like 3333 for hidden admin panels, often with permissive CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) headers.  
*SQL hunting helps identify new threats*: Hunt.io's rules surfaced 50+ related servers with similar infrastructure and code fingerprints.
