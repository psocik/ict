Security researchers from SafetyDetectives found the information on an online forum notorious for hosting database leaks and cracked software.

The user who posted the information didn't stop at simply making the claim; they also published a 34-line sample of the database, with the full dataset made freely available to registered users who interacted with the post.

The compromised data includes:

- User IDs
- Full names
- Company names
- Email addresses
- Physical addresses
- Phone numbers
- Passwords and password reset keys
- Bank account details, including bank names, types, codes, and account numbers
- Support ticket information, such as IP addresses and full message contents

While the data looks authentic, SafetyDetectives could not verify its origin.
