In a significant victory for international law enforcement, four Ghanaian nationals alleged to be the leaders of a massive cybercrime enterprise have been extradited to the United States to face charges. The U.S. Department of Justice alleges that the individuals ran a global fraud ring responsible for stealing over $100 million from victims through sophisticated romance scams and Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks.

The defendants were allegedly high-ranking members of a major international fraud ring based in Ghana that targeted companies and individuals across the United States between 2016 and May 2023. Isaac Oduro Boateng (also known as "Kofi Boat"), Inusah Ahmed ("Pascal"), Derrick Van Yeboah ("Van"), and Patrick Kwame Asare ("Borgar") were extradited from Ghana and arrived in the United States on August 7.
