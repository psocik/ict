## Executive Summary  
CYFIRMA has identified a sophisticated cyber-espionage campaign orchestrated by APT36 (also known as Transparent Tribe), a threat actor based in Pakistan. This campaign specifically targets personnel within the Indian defense sector. In a notable shift from previous methodologies, APT36 has adapted its tactics to focus on Linux-based environments, with a particular emphasis on systems running BOSS Linux, a distribution extensively utilized by Indian government agencies.

The attack vector involves the dissemination of phishing emails containing a ZIP file attachment that houses a malicious .desktop file, which serves as a Linux shortcut. Upon execution by the victim, the file triggers a dual-action mechanism: it downloads and opens a legitimate PowerPoint (.pptx) file to create a facade of authenticity and divert the user’s attention, while simultaneously downloading and executing a malicious ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) binary in the background. This ELF file acts as the primary payload, designed to compromise the host system and facilitate unauthorized access.

This multi-stage approach is intended to bypass user suspicion and evade traditional security measures, enabling threat actors to gain persistent access to sensitive environments. The deployment of Linux-specific malware signifies a noteworthy advancement in APT36’s operational capabilities and highlights the increasing risk posed to critical government and defense infrastructure.

Considering this development, organizations, particularly those operating within the public sector and utilizing Linux-based systems, are strongly advised to treat this threat as a matter of high priority and to implement robust cybersecurity controls and threat detection mechanisms to mitigate potential risks.
