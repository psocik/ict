## Italy Blames Russia-Linked Hackers for Cyberattacks Ahead of Winter Olympics

Italy has successfully thwarted a series of cyberattacks of **Russian origin** targeting diplomatic missions abroad and sites linked to the upcoming **Winter Olympics**. Foreign Minister **Antonio Tajani** revealed on Wednesday that these attempted attacks affected multiple foreign ministry offices, starting with **Washington**, as well as facilities connected to the **2026 Winter Games**, including hotels in the beautiful Alpine resort of **Cortina d’Ampezzo**. 🌍🏅

According to reports from **France 24**, approximately **120 targets** were impacted, including consulates in **Sydney**, **Toronto**, and **Paris**, alongside hotels where winter sports athletes are staying. Fortunately, the attacks did not cause significant disruption. 🙌

The pro-Russian hacker group **NoName057(16)** claimed responsibility for these attacks, stating that they were a form of retaliation for Italy’s support of Ukraine. They declared, "The Italian government’s pro-Ukrainian policy means that support for Ukrainian terrorists is punished with our DDoS attacks," on their Telegram channel. This group, which emerged shortly after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in **2022**, has primarily targeted European countries that support Kyiv, including **Poland**, **Czechia**, **Lithuania**, and **Italy**. 💻⚔️

Historically, Russia-linked hackers have targeted nations hosting major sporting events. For instance, during the **2018 Winter Olympics** in **Pyeongchang**, the Russian state-sponsored hacking group **Sandworm** disrupted the Games’ IT infrastructure using malware in a false-flag operation designed to implicate North Korean and Chinese actors. In another incident, the Kremlin-backed group **Fancy Bear** breached the **World Anti-Doping Agency** in **2016**, leaking athletes’ medical data to undermine regulators investigating the Russian doping scandal. 🏆🚨

As we approach the **2024 Summer Olympics**, authorities and researchers in **France** have already reported an increase in cyber and disinformation activities originating from Russia.
