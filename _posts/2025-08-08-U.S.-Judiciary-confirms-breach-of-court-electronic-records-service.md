The U.S. Federal Judiciary has officially confirmed that its electronic case management systems (CM/ECF and PACER) were targeted by a "sophisticated and persistent" cyberattack. This statement came in response to a Politico report that claimed a breach had occurred on the U.S. Court system's case management system, exposing sensitive information, including the identities of confidential informants.
