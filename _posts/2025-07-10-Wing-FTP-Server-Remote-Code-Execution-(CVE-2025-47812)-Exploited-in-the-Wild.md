**TL;DR:** Huntress saw active exploitation of Wing FTP Server remote code execution (CVE-2025-47812) on a customer on July 1, 2025. Organizations running Wing FTP Server should update to the fixed version, version 7.4.4, as soon as possible.

CVE-2025-47812 is a null byte and Lua injection flaw that can lead to root/SYSTEM-level remote code execution if exploited. The vulnerability was first publicly disclosed on June 30 by Julien Ahrens in versions prior to 7.4.4 of the Wing FTP Server, its file transfer protocol software for Windows, Linux, and macOS.

At a high level, CVE-2025-47812 stems from how null bytes are handled in the username parameter (specifically related to the loginok.html file, which handles the authentication process). This can allow remote attackers to perform Lua injection after using the null byte in the username parameter.
