**Key Takeaways**  
Anubis is an emerging Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) operation that combines file encryption with file destruction — a rare dual-threat capability.  
The ransomware features a “wipe mode,” which permanently erases files, rendering recovery impossible even if the ransom is paid.  
Anubis runs a flexible affiliate program, offering negotiable revenue splits and supporting additional monetization paths like data extortion and access sales.  
Active since December 2024, Anubis has claimed victims in multiple sectors including healthcare and construction, across regions such as Australia, Canada, Peru, and the U.S.
