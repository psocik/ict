Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a new malware loader called **QuirkyLoader** that's being used to deliver via email spam campaigns an array of next-stage payloads ranging from information stealers to remote access trojans since November 2024. Some of the notable malware families distributed using QuirkyLoader include **Agent Tesla**, **AsyncRAT**, **Formbook**, **Masslogger**, **Remcos RAT**, **Rhadamanthys Stealer**, and **Snake Keylogger**.  A noteworthy aspect of the kit is the use of a technique known as **precision-validated phishing** in which the attacker validates an email address in real-time in the background, while a fake Cloudflare Turnstile challenge is served to the user. Once the checks are passed, a login form impersonating the legitimate online platform appears, allowing the threat actors to capture submitted credentials and then relay them to the service.
