Remy Ra St Felix, 25, was sentenced to an additional six years and ten months last week following an assault on a witness who testified against him in a trial that related to a string of vicious robberies between September 2022 and July 2023. St Felix, of West Palm Beach, Florida, was found guilty of all nine counts related to his role as ringleader of an international crime gang, and as we reported last year, was sentenced to 47 years behind bars in June 2024.

The court heard of his various exploits, which in one case involved assaulting an elderly couple, restraining them with zip ties, and demanding they empty their cryptocurrency wallets – containing assets worth more than $150,000 at the time – into his own.

The gang leader's original sentence was for 47 years in prison. For the additional six years and ten months, he will serve 36 months concurrently with his previous sentence, and the remaining 46 months will run after. He'll also have to pay $524,153.39 in restitution. Eleven of St Felix's gang members were sentenced alongside him to a collective 191 years.
