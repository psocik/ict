Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a new phishing campaign that exploits social media private messages to propagate malicious payloads, likely with the intent to deploy a remote access trojan (RAT). The activity delivers "weaponized files via Dynamic Link Library (DLL) sideloading, combined with a legitimate, open-source Python pen-testing script," ReliaQuest said in a report shared with The Hacker News. The attack involves approaching high-value individuals through messages sent on LinkedIn, establishing trust, and deceiving them into downloading a malicious WinRAR self-extracting archive (SFX). Once launched, the archive extracts four different components - a legitimate open-source PDF reader application, a malicious DLL that's sideloaded by the PDF reader, a portable executable (PE) of the Python interpreter, and a RAR file that likely serves as a decoy. The infection chain gets activated when the PDF reader application is run, causing the rogue DLL to be sideloaded.

The use of DLL side-loading has become an increasingly common technique adopted by threat actors to evade detection and conceal signs of malicious activity by taking advantage of legitimate processes. Over the past week, at least three documented campaigns have leveraged DLL side-loading to deliver malware families tracked as LOTUSLITE and PDFSIDER, along with other commodity trojans and information stealers. In the campaign observed by ReliaQuest, the sideloaded DLL is used to drop the Python interpreter onto the system and create a Windows Registry Run key that ensures the Python interpreter is automatically executed upon every login. The interpreter's primary responsibility is to execute a Base64-encoded open-source shellcode that's directly executed in memory to avoid leaving forensic artifacts on disk. The final payload attempts to communicate with an external server, granting the attackers persistent remote access to the compromised host and exfiltrating data of interest.

ReliaQuest told The Hacker News that the campaign appears to be broad and opportunistic, with activity spanning various sectors and regions. This is not the first time LinkedIn has been misused for targeted attacks. In recent years, multiple North Korean threat actors, including those linked to the CryptoCore and Contagious Interview campaigns, have singled out victims by contacting them on LinkedIn under the pretext of a job opportunity and convincing them to run a malicious project as part of a supposed assessment or code review.
