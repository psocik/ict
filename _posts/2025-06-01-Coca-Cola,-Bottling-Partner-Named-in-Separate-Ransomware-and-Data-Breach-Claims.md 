Everest Ransomware Targets Coca-Cola

The Everest ransomware group has listed Coca-Cola as a victim on its dark web leak site, sharing screenshots that suggest access to internal documents and personal information of 959 Employees. These include visa and passport scans, salary data, and other HR-related records.

According to samples reviewed by Hackread, the breach appears to affect Coca-Colaâ€™s operations in the Middle East, with several files indicating that the Dubai office at the Dubai Airport Free Zone (DAFZ) may have been the specific target.

Everest has released samples that contain employee identification details and documents that typically circulate within HR departments. The nature of the leaked files indicates that personally identifiable information (PII) is involved.
