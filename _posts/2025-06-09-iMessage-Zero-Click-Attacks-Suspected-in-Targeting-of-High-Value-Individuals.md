Anomalous crashes on iPhones belonging to high-value individuals in the EU and US can potentially be associated with sophisticated zero-click attacks targeting an iMessage vulnerability, mobile EDR firm iVerify says.

The suspicious activity, observed in late 2024 and early 2025, with the most recent incidents dated March 2025, supposedly targeted six devices belonging to individuals affiliated with political campaigns, governments, media organizations, and tech companies in the EU and US.

On four of the devices, the security firm found signatures associated with the exploited vulnerability, called Nickname, while the other two showed clear signs of exploitation. All victims were previously targeted by Chinese state-sponsored hackers.

At least one of the victims, iVerify says in a technical report (PDF), received an Apple Threat Notification approximately one month after the crashes.
