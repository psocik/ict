## How to Set Up Private DNS Mode on Your iPhone - Why You Should Do It ASAP

Unencrypted DNS can expose your browsing activity, but private DNS helps keep it secure on iPhone. A private DNS for your iPhone can offer extra security against unwanted tracking, phishing, and malware. 🚀

If you're at a hotel or using airport Wi-Fi, you don't want the network owner seeing the sites your iPhone requests, which is where a private DNS comes in. While your internet provider protects most of your browsing with its own DNS, some private options can be faster than your ISP's and protect you outside the home. A private Domain Name System (DNS) essentially translates website names into IP addresses when you browse the internet. Turning website addresses into IP addresses hides your browsing activity from your internet provider.

### Setting Up Private DNS on Your iPhone
To set up a DNS on iPhone, begin by going to your Wi-Fi settings. You can access your iPhone's Wi-Fi settings either by swiping down on the top right of your screen to access your Control Panel or by going directly into your iPhone's Settings. Once in the Wi-Fi settings, tap the blue 'i' icon by the name of your network.

Within the new menu, select **Configure DNS** and then choose **Manual**. The next critical step is to remove the existing servers. After that, tap **Add Server**, and then enter your new address. This is where you'll add your preferred DNS server address, depending on the DNS provider you chose. For example, this could be `1.1.1.1` for Cloudflare, `8.8.8.8` or `8.8.4.4` for Google, or `9.9.9.9` for Quad9.
