Ransomware attackers targeting a Fortune 100 company in the finance sector used a new malware strain, dubbed PDFSider, to deliver malicious payloads on Windows systems. The attackers employed social engineering in their attempt to gain remote access by impersonating technical support workers and to trick company employees into installing Microsoft's Quick Assist tool. Researchers at cybersecurity company Resecurity found PDFSider during an incident response and describe it as a stealthy backdoor for long-term access, noting that it shows "characteristics commonly associated with APT tradecraft." A Resecurity spokesperson told BleepingComputer that PDFSider has been seen deployed in Qilin ransomware attacks. However, the company's threat hunting team notes that the backdoor is already "actively used" by multiple ransomware actors to launch their payloads. \n \nThe PDFSider backdoor is delivered via spearphishing emails that carry a ZIP archive with a legitimate, digitally signed executable for the PDF24 Creator tool from Miron Geek Software GmbH. However, the package also includes a malicious version of a DLL (cryptbase.dll), which the application requires to function properly. When the executable runs, it loads the attacker's DLL file, a technique known as DLL side-loading, and provides code execution on the system. "The EXE file has a legitimate signature; however, the PDF24 software has vulnerabilities that attackers were able to exploit to load this malware and bypass EDR systems effectively," Resecurity explains.\n \nPDFSider loads straight into memory, leaving minimal disk artifacts, and uses anonymous pipes to launch commands via CMD. Infected hosts are assigned a unique identifier, and system information is collected and exfiltrated to the attacker’s VPS server over DNS (port 53). PDFSider protects its command-and-control (C2) exchange by using the Botan 3.0.0 cryptographic library and AES-256-GCM for encryption, decrypting incoming data in memory to minimize its footprint on the host. "This type of cryptographic implementation is typical of remote shell malware used in targeted attacks, where maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of communications is critical," Resecurity notes. The malware also features several anti-analysis mechanisms, such as RAM size checks and debugger detection, to exit early when signs of running in a sandbox are detected.\n \nBased on its assessment, Resecurity says that PDFSider is closer to "espionage tradecraft than financially motivated malware" and is built as a stealthy backdoor that can maintain long-term covert access and provide flexible remote command execution and encrypted communication.\n \nTo read the complete article see: [Bleeping Computer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-pdfsider-windows-malware-deployed-on-fortune-100-firms-network/)
