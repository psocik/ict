Australia’s University of Melbourne last year used Wi-Fi location data to identify student protestors.

The University used Wi-Fi to identify students who participated in the July 2024 sit-in protest. As described in a report [PDF](https://ovic.vic.gov.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Report-University-of-Melbourne-University-Use-of-surveillance.pdf) into the matter by the state of Victoria’s Office of the Information Commissioner, the University directed protestors to leave the building they occupied and warned those who remained could be suspended, disciplined, or reported to police.

The report says 22 chose to remain, and the University used CCTV and Wi-Fi location data to identify them. The Information Commissioner found that use of CCTV to identify protestors did not breach privacy, but felt using Wi-Fi location data did because the University’s policies lacked detail.
