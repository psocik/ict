Security researchers managed to access live feeds of 40,000 internet-connected cameras worldwide, highlighting significant security concerns.  

Supporting the bulletin issued by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) earlier this year, which warned of exposed cameras potentially being used in Chinese espionage campaigns, the team at Bitsight tapped into feeds from sensitive locations.  

The US was the most affected region, with around 14,000 feeds streaming from the country, allowing access to the interiors of datacenters, healthcare facilities, factories, and more.  

Bitsight noted that these feeds could be exploited for espionage, mapping blind spots, and acquiring trade secrets, among other threats.
