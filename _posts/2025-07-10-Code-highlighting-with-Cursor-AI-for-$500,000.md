Attacks that leverage malicious open-source packages are becoming a major and growing threat. This type of attack currently seems commonplace, with reports of infected packages in repositories like PyPI or npm appearing almost daily. It would seem that increased scrutiny from researchers on these repositories should have long ago minimized the profits for cybercriminals trying to make a fortune from malicious packages. However, our investigation into a recent cyber incident once again confirmed that open-source packages remain an attractive way for attackers to make easy money.

In June 2025, a blockchain developer from Russia reached out to us after falling victim to a cyberattack. He had around $500,000 in crypto assets stolen from him. Surprisingly, the victim‚Äôs operating system had been installed only a few days prior. Nothing but essential and popular apps had been downloaded to the machine. The developer was well aware of the cybersecurity risks associated with crypto transactions, so he was vigilant and carefully reviewed his every step while working online. Additionally, he used free online services for malware detection to protect his system, but no commercial antivirus software.

The circumstances of the infection piqued our interest, and we decided to investigate the origins of the incident. After obtaining a disk image of the infected system, we began our analysis.
