Attacks that leverage malicious open-source packages are becoming a major and growing threat. This type of attacks currently seems commonplace, with reports of infected packages in repositories like PyPI or npm appearing almost daily. Increased scrutiny from researchers on these repositories should have minimized the profits for cybercriminals trying to profit from malicious packages. However, our investigation into a recent cyber incident confirmed that open-source packages remain an attractive way for attackers to make easy money.

In June 2025, a blockchain developer from Russia contacted us after falling victim to a cyberattack, resulting in the theft of around $500,000 in crypto assets. Surprisingly, the victimâ€™s operating system had been installed only a few days prior. Only essential and popular apps had been downloaded, and despite being aware of cybersecurity risks, the victim had used free online services for malware detection instead of commercial antivirus software.

These circumstances piqued our interest, leading us to investigate the incident's origins. After obtaining a disk image of the infected system, we began our analysis.
