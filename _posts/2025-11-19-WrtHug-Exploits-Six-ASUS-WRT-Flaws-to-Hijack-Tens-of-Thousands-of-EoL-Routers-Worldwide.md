A newly discovered campaign has compromised tens of thousands of outdated or end-of-life (EoL) ASUS routers worldwide, predominantly in Taiwan, the U.S., and Russia, to rope them into a massive network.

The attacks likely involve the exploitation of six known security flaws in end-of-life ASUS WRT routers to take control of susceptible devices. All the infected routers have been found to share a unique self-signed TLS certificate with an expiration date set for 100 years from April 2022.

The attacks likely exploit vulnerabilities tracked as [CVE-2023-41345], [CVE-2023-41346], [CVE-2023-41347], [CVE-2023-41348], [CVE-2023-39780], [CVE-2024-12912], and [CVE-2025-2492] for proliferation. Interestingly, the exploitation of CVE-2023-39780 has also been linked to another Chinese-origin botnet dubbed [AyySSHush] (aka ViciousTrap). Two other ORBs that have targeted routers in recent months are [LapDogs] and [PolarEdge].

"By chaining command injections and authentication bypasses, threat actors have managed to deploy persistent backdoors via SSH, often abusing legitimate router features to ensure their presence survives reboots or firmware updates."
