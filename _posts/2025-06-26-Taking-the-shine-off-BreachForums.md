On June 25, 2025, French authorities announced that four members of the ShinyHunters (also known as ShinyCorp) cybercriminal group were arrested in multiple French regions for cybercrime activities and involvement in the English-language underground forum known as BreachForums. The coordinated global law enforcement effort targeting the â€˜ShinyHuntersâ€™, â€˜Hollowâ€™, â€˜Noctâ€™, and â€˜Depressedâ€™ personas followed the February arrest of Kai West (also known as â€˜IntelBrokerâ€™), who previously administered BreachForums.

The ShinyHunters threat group has been active since 2020 and has compromised organizations in industries such as telecommunications, e-commerce, technology, and retail. The group is known for selling stolen data exclusively on RaidForums and BreachForums. The ShinyHunters persona was a key participant in these forums as a contributor and administrator.

Since its original creation as RaidForums in 2015, BreachForums had been taken down numerous times and had been administered by multiple personas.
