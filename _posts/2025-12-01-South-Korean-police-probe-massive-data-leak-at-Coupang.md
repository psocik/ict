The personal data of more than 33 million customers was leaked in a breach believed to have started on June 24 through overseas servers, though the company did not learn of the problem until November 18.

South Korea's Science Minister Bae Kyung-hoon said on Sunday the perpetrator had "abused authentication vulnerabilities" in Coupang's servers, and that authorities would be investigating whether the company violated rules regarding the protection of personal information.

A former employee used their authentication key that was still active after the termination of the person's contract to get access to customer information, lawmaker Choi Min-hee said in a statement on Monday.

Coupang, which is backed by Japan's SoftBank Group, has said the breach exposed customers' names, email addresses, phone numbers, shipping addresses, and certain order histories, but not payment details or login credentials.
