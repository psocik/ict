Cyber-crime crew Scattered Spider has infected US insurance companies following a series of ransomware attacks against American and British retailers, according to Google, which urged this sector to be on "high alert."

The warning follows multiple disclosures from insurance companies about digital break-ins and system outages disrupting customer access.

"Google Threat Intelligence Group is now aware of multiple intrusions in the US which bear all the hallmarks of Scattered Spider activity. We are now seeing incidents in the insurance industry," chief analyst John Hultquist said in a statement emailed to The Register.

"Given this actor's history of focusing on a sector at a time, the insurance industry should be on high alert, especially for social engineering schemes, which target their help desks and call centers," Hultquist added.
