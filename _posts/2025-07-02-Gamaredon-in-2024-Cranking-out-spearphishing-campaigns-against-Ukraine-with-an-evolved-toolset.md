Key points of this blogpost:

- Gamaredon refocused exclusively on targeting Ukrainian governmental institutions in 2024, abandoning prior attempts against NATO countries.
- The group significantly increased the scale and frequency of spearphishing campaigns, employing new delivery methods such as malicious hyperlinks and LNK files executing PowerShell from Cloudflare-hosted domains.
- Gamaredon introduced six new malware tools, leveraging PowerShell and VBScript, designed primarily for stealth, persistence, and lateral movement.
- Existing tools received major upgrades, including enhanced obfuscation, improved stealth tactics, and sophisticated methods for lateral movement and data exfiltration.
- Gamaredon operators managed to hide almost their entire C&C infrastructure behind Cloudflare tunnels.
- Gamaredon increasingly relied on third-party services (Telegram, Telegraph, Cloudflare, Dropbox) and DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) for protecting its C&C infrastructure.
