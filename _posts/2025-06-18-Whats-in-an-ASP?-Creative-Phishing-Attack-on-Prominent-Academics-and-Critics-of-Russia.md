In cooperation with external partners, Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) observed a Russian state-sponsored cyber threat actor impersonating the U.S. Department of State. From at least April through early June 2025, this actor targeted prominent academics and critics of Russia, often using extensive rapport building and tailored lures to convince the target to set up application specific passwords (ASPs). Once the target shares the ASP passcode, the attackers establish persistent access to the victimâ€™s mailbox. Two distinct campaigns are detailed in this post. This activity aligns with Citizen Labâ€™s recent research on social engineering attacks against ASPs, another useful resource for high-risk users.

GTIG tracks this activity as UNC6293, a likely Russian state-sponsored cyber actor associated with APT29 / ICECAP. After establishing rapport, the attacker sent phishing lures disguised as meeting invitations, and added spoofed Department of State email addresses on the cc line of the initial outreach to increase the legitimacy of the contact attempt. The initial phishing email itself is not directly malicious, but encourages the victim to respond to set up a meeting.
