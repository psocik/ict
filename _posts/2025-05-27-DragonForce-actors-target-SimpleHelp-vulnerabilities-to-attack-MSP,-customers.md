Sophos MDR recently responded to a targeted attack involving a Managed Service Provider (MSP). In this incident, a threat actor gained access to the MSPâ€™s remote monitoring and management (RMM) tool, SimpleHelp, and then used it to deploy DragonForce ransomware across multiple endpoints. The attackers also exfiltrated sensitive data, leveraging a double extortion tactic to pressure victims into paying the ransom.

Sophos MDR has medium confidence the threat actor exploited a chain of vulnerabilities that were released in January 2025:

- CVE-2024-57727: Multiple path traversal vulnerabilities  
- CVE-2024-57728: Arbitrary file upload vulnerability  
- CVE-2024-57726: Privilege escalation vulnerability
