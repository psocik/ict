EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

In May 2025, a set of critical zero-day vulnerabilities was disclosed in Versa Concerto, a popular SD-WAN and SASE solution used across enterprises for secure cloud and network operations. Among them, CVE-2025-34027 stands out due to its severity and exploitability. The flaw stems from a path-based authentication bypass vulnerability in Concertoâ€™s orchestration platform RESTful API, which allows unauthenticated attackers to gain administrative access and execute arbitrary commands remotely.

The vulnerability enables improper access control enforcement in API endpoints, where authentication mechanisms can be trivially bypassed by manipulating the request path. This can give threat actors direct access to sensitive functions that typically require administrator-level privileges. Moreover, CVE-2025-34027 is part of a broader cluster of unpatched issues (including CVE-2025-34025 and CVE-2025-34026), raising red flags about the overall security posture of the platform.
