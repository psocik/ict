The incident came to light on July 24, when Cisco learned that one of its representatives had been targeted in a vishing attack. The threat actor had managed to access and steal a "subset of basic profile information" from an instance of a third-party CRM system used by Cisco.

The networking giant immediately took steps to terminate the hackerâ€™s access to the CRM system. An investigation determined that the attacker obtained information provided by individuals who registered an account on Cisco.com.

The compromised information includes name, email address, phone number, organization name, address, a Cisco-assigned user ID, and metadata related to the account (eg, account creation date).

Cisco said the hacker did not obtain any confidential or proprietary information belonging to its organizational customers. Passwords or other types of sensitive data were also not affected.
