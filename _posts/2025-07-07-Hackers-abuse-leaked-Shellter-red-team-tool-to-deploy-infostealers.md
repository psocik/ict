Shellter Project, the vendor of a commercial AV/EDR evasion loader for penetration testing, confirmed that hackers used its Shellter Elite product in attacks after a customer leaked a copy of the software.

The abuse has kept going for several months and even though security researchers caught the activity in the wild, Shellter did not receive a notification.

The vendor underlined that this is the first known incident of misuse since it introduced its strict licensing model in February 2023.

"We discovered that a company which had recently purchased Shellter Elite licenses had leaked their copy of the software," Shellter says in a statement.
