China on Sunday accused the U.S. National Security Agency of carrying out cyberattacks on its national time center following an investigation, saying any damage to related facilities could have disrupted network communications, financial systems, and power supply.

The Ministry of State Security alleged in a WeChat post that the U.S. agency had exploited vulnerabilities in the messaging services of a foreign mobile phone brand to steal sensitive information from devices of the National Time Service Centerâ€™s staff in 2022. It did not specify the brand.

The U.S. agency also used 42 types of "special cyberattack weapons" to target the centerâ€™s multiple internal network systems and attempted to infiltrate a key timing system between 2023 and 2024, it said.

It said the time center is responsible for generating and distributing Chinaâ€™s standard time, in addition to providing timing services to industries such as communications, finance, power, transport, and defense. It had provided guidance to the center to eliminate the risks.
