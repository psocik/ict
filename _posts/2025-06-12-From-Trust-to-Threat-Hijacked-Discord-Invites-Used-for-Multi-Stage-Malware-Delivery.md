Key Takeaways

Check Point Research uncovered an active malware campaign exploiting expired and released Discord invite links. Attackers hijacked the links through vanity link registration, allowing them to silently redirect users from trusted sources to malicious servers.

The attackers combined the ClickFix phishing technique, multi-stage loaders, and time-based evasions to stealthily deliver AsyncRAT, and a customized Skuld Stealer targeting crypto wallets.

Payload delivery and data exfiltration occur exclusively via trusted cloud services such as GitHub, Bitbucket, Pastebin, and Discord, helping the operation blend into normal traffic and avoid raising alarms.

The operation continues to evolve, and threat actors can now bypass Chromeâ€™s App Bound Encryption (ABE) by using adapted tools like ChromeKatz to steal cookies from new Chromium browser versions.
