Since November 2024, Mandiant Threat Defense has been investigating an UNC6032 campaign that weaponizes the interest around AI tools, particularly those that generate videos based on user prompts. UNC6032 utilizes fake "AI video generator" websites to distribute malware, leading to the deployment of payloads such as Python-based infostealers and several backdoors. Victims are typically directed to these fake websites via malicious social media ads that masquerade as legitimate AI video generator tools like Luma AI, Canva Dream Lab, and Kling AI, among others. Mandiant Threat Defense has identified thousands of UNC6032-linked ads that have collectively reached millions of users across various social media platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn. We suspect similar campaigns are active on other platforms, as cybercriminals consistently evolve tactics to evade detection and target multiple platforms to increase their chances of success.

Mandiant Threat Defense observed UNC6032 compromises culminating in the exfiltration of login credentials, cookies, credit card data, and Facebook information through the Telegram API. This campaign has been active since at least mid-2024 and has impacted victims across different geographies and industries. Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) assesses UNC6032 to have a Vietnam nexus.

Mandiant Threat Defense acknowledges Meta's collaborative and proactive threat hunting efforts in removing the identified malicious ads, domains, and accounts. Notably, a significant portion of Metaâ€™s detection and removal began in 2024, prior to Mandiant alerting them of the additional malicious activity identified.
