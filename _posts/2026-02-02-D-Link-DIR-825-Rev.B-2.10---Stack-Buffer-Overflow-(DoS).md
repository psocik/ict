A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability, identified as CVE-2025-10666, exists in the `apply.cgi` endpoint of the D-Link DIR-825 Rev.B router (firmware <= 2.10). This vulnerability, explicitly titled 'D-Link DIR-825 Rev.B 2.10 - Stack Buffer Overflow (DoS)', was publicly disclosed on 2025-09-25 by Exploit Author Beatriz Fresno Naumova. The description indicates that this vulnerability is triggered via the `countdown_time` parameter.

The vulnerability impacts D-Link DIR-825 Rev.B routers with firmware version <= 2.10. The discovery was tested on DIR-825 Rev.B physical hardware, within a local network environment. A Proof-of-Concept (PoC) for this vulnerability has been developed. This PoC sends an overly long POST parameter to crash the process, ultimately leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition on the affected router.

The PoC targets a `TARGET` URL of `https:192.168.0.1/apply.cgi`. The exploit payload is explicitly constructed by setting a `LENGTH` variable to 4000 and defining the `PAYLOAD` as "1" * LENGTH. This `PAYLOAD` is then used for the `countdown_time` parameter within the `data` portion of the HTTP POST request. The `headers` for the request are specifically set to include `User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0`, `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, and `Referer: http://192.168.0.1/`.

During execution, the PoC prints the message '[+] Sending exploit payload (4000 bytes) to http://192.168.0.1/apply.cgi'. After sending the request, it reports the `Status Code` returned by the server. Finally, the PoC advises users to '[+] Exploit sent. Check if the router crashes or becomes unresponsive.'
