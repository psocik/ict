The Everest ransomware group is claiming responsibility for the September breach of Collins Aerospace and its MUSE check-in software – in an attack that impacted multiple major airports across Europe, causing travel chaos for days.  
The Everest ransomware cartel, which also made waves last month with a purported attack on luxury automaker BMW, claims to have exfiltrated a 50+ GB database from one of the world’s leading commercial and military defense companies.  
A spokesperson from RTX, Collins Aerospace’s parent company, put out a statement identifying a “cyber-related disruption” in its Arinc cMUSE software at certain airports… and that the impact was “limited to electronic customer check-in and baggage drop and could be mitigated with manual check-in operations.”  
Collins Aerospace was reported to have told Heathrow that an estimated 1,000 computers had been “corrupted” in the attack, and could only be brought back online in person.
