In May 2025, Cisco Talos identified a Python-based remote access trojan (RAT) we call "PylangGhost," used exclusively by a North Korean-aligned threat actor. PylangGhost is functionally similar to the previously documented GolangGhost RAT, sharing many of the same capabilities.

In recent campaigns, the threat actor Famous Chollima — potentially made up of multiple groups — has been using a Python-based version of their trojan to target Windows systems, while continuing to deploy a Golang-based version for MacOS users. Linux users are not targeted in these latest campaigns.

The attacks are targeting employees with experience in cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies.

Based on open-source intelligence, only a small number of users, predominantly in India, are affected. Cisco product telemetry does not indicate that there are any affected Cisco users.
