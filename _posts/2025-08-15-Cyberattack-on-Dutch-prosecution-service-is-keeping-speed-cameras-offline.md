The Dutch newspaper Leeuwarder Courant has reported that dozens of speed cameras remain offline after they were temporarily shut down following the system compromise. The cyberattack itself, which originally took place on July 17 and involved exploited Citrix vulnerabilities, did not affect the cameras directly, but is preventing the CVOM from bringing them back online. Earlier this week, the Dutch NCSC updated its reporting on the Citrix NetScaler zero-day disclosed last month, saying several critical organizations across the country had been compromised.

The Public Prosecution Service announced on August 5 that it would start a phased relaunch process, saying the decision to return slowly was made to decrease the risk of any further disruption to the criminal justice system. "A phased relaunch is also necessary because the systems and applications are interconnected as well as linked to those of, for example, the judiciary, the police, the CJIB (Central Fine Collection Agency), and the NFI (Netherlands Forensic Institute)," its statement read.
