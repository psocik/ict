In brief: 
AFP Commissioner Krissy Barrett revealed Wednesday how a data scientist unlocked over $6 million from a crypto wallet held by an “alleged criminal.” The data scientist was able to access the wallet by identifying fabricated digits in a seed phrase sequence. The same analyst has since cracked another wallet using a different method, recovering more than $1.9 million (AU$3 million), Barrett said.

The analyst was presented with an image displaying random numbers and words, divided into groups of six with "more than 50 variations of the number groups," Barrett explained. After having "one of those scientific epiphanies," the analyst realised that the alleged criminal had “tried to create a crypto booby prize in how the numbers were presented,” Barrett said. After stripping the first digit from each sequence, what remained was decoded into a 24-word recovery phrase.
