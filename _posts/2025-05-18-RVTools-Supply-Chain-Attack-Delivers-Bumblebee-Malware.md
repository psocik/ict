Arctic Wolf has recently observed the distribution of a trojanized RVTools installer via a malicious typosquatted domain. The domain matches the legitimate domain, however, the Top Level Domain (TLD) is changed from .com to .org. RVTools is a widely used VMware utility for inventory and configuration reporting, developed by Robware. Once the malicious installer was downloaded, it attempts to make outbound connections to known command and control infrastructure. However, those attempts were intercepted and sinkholed, preventing additional analysis on the final payload.

Notably, according to open source reporting, the official RVTools website was likely compromised to deliver a malicious installer containing a version.dll file that deploys the Bumblebee malware loader. The Bumblebee malware enables threat actors to gain persistent access, execute additional malicious payloads, steal data, and facilitate ransomware or further attacks within a compromised system.

While the exact timeline of the compromise is unknown, reports of the malicious installer began emerging in mid-May 2025. At the time of writing, both legitimate RVTools sites (Robware.net and RVTools.com) are down, with no indication of when they will be restored.
