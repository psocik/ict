In recent months, there has been a significant surge in crypto and investment scams exploiting the Tesla brand, particularly targeting cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors.

Scammers are capitalizing on Tesla’s global reputation, its high media visibility, and CEO Elon Musk’s vocal support for emerging technologies such as Bitcoin and Dogecoin.

These scams typically involve impersonation tactics that present fraudulent investment opportunities or cryptocurrency giveaways, often using Tesla’s logo, imagery, and fabricated endorsements. Fake YouTube livestreams, cloned websites, sponsored ads, and social media accounts posing as Tesla or Elon Musk are frequently employed to create a sense of legitimacy and urgency.

This trend underscores a broader evolution in scam sophistication, including:

- Real-time interaction via chatbots on fake investment platforms and Telegram/Whatsapp etc.
- Reuse of infrastructure and templates across multiple scam operations.
