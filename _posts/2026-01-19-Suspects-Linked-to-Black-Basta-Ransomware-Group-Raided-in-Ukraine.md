Law enforcement agencies from Ukraine and Germany have raided the house of two suspected members of the Black Basta ransomware group, seizing evidence of their involvement in cybercriminal activities. According to investigators, the pair performed the roles of ‘hash crackers,’ individuals who specialize in extracting passwords from account databases in information systems using specialized software. This allowed the ransomware gang to gain unauthorized access to companies' internal systems, expand the privileges of compromised accounts within corporate networks, steal data and deploy ransomware. This action was taken as part of a wider international law enforcement investigation spearheaded by Europol and involving services in the Netherlands, Switzerland and the UK. The operation led to the identification of Oleg Evgenievich Nefedov, a 35-year-old Russian national who is believed to be one of the founders and leaders of Black Basta. He may have been involved in the activities of Conti, another now-defunct ransomware group.
