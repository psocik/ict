Romance scams are a form of social-engineering fraud that causes both financial and emotional harm. They vary in technique and platform, but most follow the same high-level roadmap: initial contact, relationship building, financial exploitation. This analysis focuses on the initial stages of the romance scam – how scammers make contact, build rapport, and prime victims for later financial requests.

The researcher was contacted by two separate romance scammers on WhatsApp, acting as a victim for around two weeks to observe the first few phases. Both conversations began the same way – the sender claimed they had messaged the wrong person. That ‘wrong-number’ ruse is low effort and high reward. It gives the out-of-the-blue message a plausible reason, invites a short helpful reply, and lowers suspicion.

After a few messages, both scammers claimed to be foreigners working in the UK, both claiming the same job – Business Analyst – which later supports credibility when discussing investments. Their job descriptions are lengthy and well-written, lacking earlier quirks – suggesting scripted replies. After a few days of texting, both explained they were using a business number and asked to move to a ‘personal’ one, a plausible and low-friction excuse.

By the second week, both began describing financial success and sent images of cars, apartments, gym visits, and meals to build trust. Both positioned themselves as successful investors with diversified portfolios. Ultimately, direct money requests usually come much later, after deep emotional commitment.

For practical advice, if you receive a random ‘wrong number’ message, be cautious – do not share personal information. Always be suspicious if someone quickly asks to move off-platform or to a new number. Ask for a live video call – repeated refusal is a major red flag. Reverse-image search any profile photos received. Never send money, gift cards, or personal documents to someone you only know online.
