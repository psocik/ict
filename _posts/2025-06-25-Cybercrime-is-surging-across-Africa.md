The report, published this week, paints a sobering picture with two-thirds of surveyed African countries reporting that cybercrime represents a medium-to-high proportion of their total reported crime.

In parts of Western and Eastern Africa, that proportion has skyrocketed, reaching or exceeding 30%.

The most reported cyber threats - according to the report - are online scams, ransomware, business email compromise, and digital sextortion, with suspected scam notifications rising an eye-opening 3000% in the last year in some African countries.

Ransomware, as with the rest of the world, is a significant problem in Africa - with South Africa and Egypt detecting the highest number of attacks at 17,849 and 12,281 respectively, followed by Nigeria (3,459) and Kenya (3,030).
