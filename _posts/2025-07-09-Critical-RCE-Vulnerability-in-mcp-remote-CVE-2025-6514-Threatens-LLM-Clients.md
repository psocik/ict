The JFrog Security Research team has recently discovered and disclosed CVE-2025-6514 – a critical (CVSS 9.6) security vulnerability in the mcp-remote project – a popular tool used by Model Context Protocol clients. The vulnerability allows attackers to trigger arbitrary OS command execution on the machine running mcp-remote when it initiates a connection to an untrusted MCP server, posing a significant risk to users – a full system compromise.

mcp-remote is a proxy that enables Large Language Model (LLM) hosts such as Claude Desktop to communicate with remote MCP servers, even if natively they only support communicating with local MCP servers.

While previously published research has demonstrated risks from MCP clients connecting to malicious MCP servers, this is the first time that full remote code execution is achieved in a real-world scenario on the client operating system when connecting to an untrusted remote MCP server.
