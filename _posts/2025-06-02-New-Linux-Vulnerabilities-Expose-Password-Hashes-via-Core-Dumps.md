Two local information-disclosure vulnerabilities have been identified in popular Linux crash-reporting tools, allowing attackers to access sensitive system data.

The vulnerabilities, uncovered by the Qualys Threat Research Unit (TRU), impact Apport on Ubuntu and systemd-coredump on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and Fedora.

CVE-2025-5054 targets Apport, Ubuntuâ€™s crash-reporting framework, while CVE-2025-4598 affects systemd-coredump, used on RHEL 9, RHEL 10 and Fedora 40/41.

Both are race-condition flaws that let local users exploit SUID programs to read core dumps from crashed processes.
