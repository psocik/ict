SAP on Tuesday released security updates to address multiple security flaws, including three critical vulnerabilities in SAP Netweaver that could result in code execution and the upload of arbitrary files.

"[CVE-2025-42944] allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands by submitting a malicious payload to an open port," Onapsis said. "A successful exploit can lead to full compromise of the application. As a temporary workaround, customers should add P4 port filtering at the ICM level to prevent unknown hosts from connecting to the P4 port."

The patches arrive days after SecurityBridge and Pathlock disclosed that a critical security defect in SAP S/4HANA that was fixed by the company last month (CVE-2025-42957, CVSS score: 9.9) has come under active exploitation in the wild.
