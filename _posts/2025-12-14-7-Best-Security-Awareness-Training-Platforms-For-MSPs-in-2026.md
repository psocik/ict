Managed service providers (MSPs) represent increasingly popular cyberattack targets, characterized by numerous endpoints and distributed networks that present adversaries with diverse exploitation opportunities. While security awareness training constitutes only one facet of defense, it remains critical as attackers frequently target unsuspecting humans directly. Social engineering, particularly phishing attacks, forms a substantial component of successful cyber campaigns, necessitating robust educational initiatives to mitigate human risk effectively.

To counter these threats, security awareness platforms are designed to automate and scale training programs for MSP clients. These platforms offer comprehensive curricula, with some providing over 150 modules spanning various cybersecurity topics. A key focus is on ensuring content is current, with many platforms updating material monthly to reflect emerging threats. Training modules are typically short, often 5-10 minutes, to maintain high engagement and accommodate busy schedules. The educational approach often includes diverse content types, such as animated videos and quizzes, catering to various learning styles and ensuring broad applicability across different workforces.

Technically, these solutions incorporate advanced capabilities for effective threat education. Automated campaign management tools simplify the setup and monitoring of user training. Customization features allow MSPs to tailor training and phishing simulations to specific industry or customer threats, enhancing relevance. Platforms can deliver randomized lures to create believable pseudo-phishing campaigns, and some actively replicate the latest attacker techniques, including quishing, deepfakes, and smishing, to prepare users for real-world scenarios. Reactive training sessions are also deployed, allowing for real-time flagging of risky behaviors and immediate corrective education to address identified vulnerabilities. Multi-language support is a common feature, addressing the needs of geographically distributed workforces.

The objective extends beyond mere compliance, aiming for measurable behavioral change and risk reduction. Integrated metrics and robust reporting features enable MSPs to track learner completion rates and measure the overall effectiveness of training programs. Advanced platforms leverage AI-powered personalization and data science to continuously adapt phishing simulations and micro-training based on individual employee risk levels, learning pace, and past behavior. This approach, combined with gamification and progress tracking, fosters a culture where employees are motivated to improve their security vigilance and actively report suspicious messages. Reporting interfaces can filter out simulation results from actual phishing attempts, providing accurate insight into an organization's true threat landscape and security posture.
