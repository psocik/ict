Noah Michael Urban, a key member of the Scattered Spider cybercrime collective, was sentenced to 10 years in prison on Wednesday after pleading guilty to charges of wire fraud and conspiracy in April.

He was arrested in January 2024, and in November, the U.S. Justice Department charged Urban (also known as King Bob, Gustavo Fring, Elijah, and Sosa), along with four other suspects linked to the same financially motivated cybercrime group. The charges included wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and aggravated identity theft.

In a May 2023 interview with investigators, Urban stated that he had made "several million dollars" from cryptocurrency theft between January 2021 and March 2023, in addition to being involved in the theft of several million more, adding he still had a few million left after losing most of his earnings on gambling sites.

As News4Jax first reported, Urban received a 120-month prison sentence, despite prosecutors having only requested eight years, and will also be required to pay $13 million in restitution to the victims.

When investigative journalist Brian Krebs contacted Urban on Twitter after the sentencing, Urban responded from a county jail in Florida, stating that he believed the sentence was unjust.

U.K. police arrested another member of Scattered Spider in July 2024, a 17-year-old suspect believed to have been involved in the 2023 MGM Resorts ransomware attack. In December 2024, U.S. authorities arrested another teenager (a 19-year-old known online as "remi" also linked to Scattered Spider), charging him with breaching a U.S. financial institution and two unnamed telecommunications firms.
