A cyber incident affecting several hospitals in Maine is now under investigation.

Covenant Health shared with NEWS CENTER Maine that it became aware of connectivity issues impacting the organization on Monday. The health care system said it immediately discontinued access to all data systems across its hospitals, clinics, and provider practices.

Covenant owns St. Joseph Hospital in Bangor, St. Mary’s Health System in Lewiston, and St. Andre Health Care in Biddeford, as well as other facilities in Lewiston and Bangor.

The organization said the issues were the result of a “cyber incident initiated from an outside group.”
