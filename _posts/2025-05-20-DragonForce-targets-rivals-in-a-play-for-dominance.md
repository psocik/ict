**Enter the dragon**

DragonForce is involved in high-impact attacks targeting both traditional IT infrastructure and virtualized environments (e.g., VMware ESXi), with a strong emphasis on credential theft, Active Directory abuse, and data exfiltration. In March 2025, it launched efforts to claim dominance in the ransomware ecosystem by introducing a more flexible affiliate model and targeting other ransomware groups.

A series of attacks on UK retailers that began in late April brought this group into sharper focus as third-party reports linked these attacks to DragonForce and the GOLD HARVEST (also known as Scattered Spider) threat group. GOLD HARVEST frequently leverages social engineering, abuse of remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) bypass techniques to gain access, steal bulk data, and sometimes deploy ransomware.

When DragonForce emerged in August 2023, it offered a traditional RaaS scheme. On March 19, 2025, the group announced a rebrand as a ‘cartel’ to expand its reach, hoping to emulate the success of LockBit and other mature ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) groups. In practice, it isn’t a cartel operation but an offering that gives affiliates the flexibility to leverage DragonForce’s infrastructure and ransomware tools while operating under their own brands.
