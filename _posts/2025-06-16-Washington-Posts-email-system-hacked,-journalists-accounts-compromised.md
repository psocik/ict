Email accounts of several Washington Post journalists were compromised in a cyberattack believed to have been carried out by a foreign government.

The incident was discovered on Thursday evening and the publication started an investigation. On Sunday, June 15, an internal memo was sent to employees, informing them of a “possible targeted unauthorized intrusion into their email system.”

According to The Wall Street Journal, the memo was signed by Executive Editor Matt Murray and informed that Microsoft accounts of a limited number of journalists were affected.
