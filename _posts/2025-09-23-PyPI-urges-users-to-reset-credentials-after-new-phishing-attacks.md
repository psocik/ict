The Python Software Foundation has warned victims of a new wave of phishing attacks using a fake Python Package Index (PyPI) website to reset credentials.

Accessible at `pypi.org`, PyPI is the default source for Python's package management tools, hosting hundreds of thousands of packages and providing developers with a centralized platform to distribute third-party software libraries.

Python Software Foundation developer Seth Larson said the phishing emails request targets to "verify their email address" for "account maintenance and security procedures," threatening them with account suspensions and redirecting to a phishing landing page at `pypi-mirror[.]org`.

Last week, the Python Software Foundation team also invalidated all PyPI tokens stolen in the GhostAction supply chain attack in early September, confirming that the threat actors had not abused them to publish malware.
