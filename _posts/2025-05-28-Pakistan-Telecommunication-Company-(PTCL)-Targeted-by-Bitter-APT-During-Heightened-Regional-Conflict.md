On May 7, 2025, during the active military escalation between Pakistan and India—specifically in the context of India’s military campaign ‘Operation Sindoor’—, EclecticIQ analysts observed that Bitter APT (also known as TA397) very likely targeted the Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited (PTCL) workers in a spear phishing campaign likely designed to deliver malware. Analysts assess that Bitter APT is very likely a South Asian state-sponsored actor conducting cyber-enabled espionage operations by stealing state and trade secrets.

EclecticIQ and Hudson Rock researchers assess that Bitter APT very likely used stolen email credentials from Pakistan’s Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) to carry out the attack. The spear phishing campaign targeted PTCL personnel in critical roles, including 5G infrastructure engineers, DevOps specialists, project managers, and satellite communication experts.
