Since 2024, Microsoft Threat Intelligence has observed remote information technology (IT) workers deployed by North Korea leveraging AI to improve the scale and sophistication of their operations, steal data, and generate revenue for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). Among the changes noted in the North Korean remote IT worker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) include the use of AI tools to replace images in stolen employment and identity documents and enhance North Korean IT worker photos to make them appear more professional. We’ve also observed that they’ve been utilizing voice-changing software.

North Korea has deployed thousands of remote IT workers to assume jobs in software and web development as part of a revenue generation scheme for the North Korean government. These highly skilled workers are most often located in North Korea, China, and Russia, and use tools such as virtual private networks (VPNs) and remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools together with witting accomplices to conceal their locations and identities.

Historically, North Korea’s fraudulent remote worker scheme has focused on targeting United States (US) companies in the technology, critical manufacturing, and transportation sectors. However, we’ve observed North Korean remote workers evolving to broaden their scope to target various industries globally that offer technology-related roles. Since 2020, the US government and cybersecurity community have identified thousands of North Korean workers infiltrating companies across various industries.
