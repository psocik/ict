### NTLM reflection is dead, long live NTLM reflection!

**Excerpt:**  
"Introduction  
NTLM reflection is a special case of NTLM authentication relay in which the original authentication is relayed back to the machine from which the authentication originated. This class of vulnerability was publicly introduced via MS08-68, where Microsoft prevented SMB to SMB NTLM reflection. Over the years, other exploitation vectors were discovered and patched, such as HTTP to SMB reflection (patched in MS09-13) or DCOM to DCOM reflection (patched in MS15-076).  
Nowadays, it is generally accepted that NTLM reflection attacks vectors are fixed, but from time to time, some researches demonstrate that bypassing mitigations is just a matter of digging into what the mitigation actually does.  
More recently, a tweet demonstrating that Kerberos reflection was not restricted sparked our interest and motivated us to dig more into authentication reflection.
