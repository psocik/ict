## Cryptocurrency Scams Target Asia 🚨

A sophisticated cryptocurrency scam campaign is currently targeting users across Asia, with a heavy and specific focus on Japan. This operation uniquely combines two distinct fraud models into a single, highly effective attack vector: **malvertising** and **“pig butchering.”** By blending the broad reach of malicious advertising with the psychological manipulation of long-term social engineering, cybercriminals are successfully stealing massive sums from unsuspecting investors. Recent reports indicate that individual victims have suffered financial losses as high as **¥10 million** after falling for these elaborate schemes.

### How the Scam Works 🔍

The attack sequence begins with malvertising, where threat actors place convincing fake advertisements on social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram. These ads frequently impersonate prominent financial experts or promote exclusive **“AI-driven”** investment algorithms to lure victims. When users click these ads, they are redirected to fraudulent **“lure”** websites designed to mimic legitimate investment portals. These sites ultimately prompt the victim to join a chat group on messaging apps such as LINE, WhatsApp, or KakaoTalk by scanning a QR code to receive **“special”** guidance.

Once victims join the messaging apps, they are engaged not by human operators, but likely by advanced **AI-driven bots**. These automated agents act as assistants, engaging victims in continuous conversations to build trust. They share fabricated success stories and encourage small initial investments that appear to yield high returns. Eventually, victims are persuaded to transfer larger sums. When they attempt to withdraw funds, the scammers demand a **“release fee,”** causing further financial damage before the criminals vanish.

### Mitigation Strategies 🛡️

To mitigate risks from such sophisticated scams, it is recommended to:
- Always verify the official accounts of financial experts before trusting social media ads.
- Be extremely skeptical of any investment opportunity that promises guaranteed or unrealistic returns.
- Avoid clicking on links or scanning QR codes from unverified sources.
- Finally, do not transfer cryptocurrency to individuals met solely through online chat groups.
