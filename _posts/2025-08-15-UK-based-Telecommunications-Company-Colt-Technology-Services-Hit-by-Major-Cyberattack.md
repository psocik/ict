UK-based telecommunications company Colt Technology Services is dealing with a cyberattack that has caused a multi-day outage of some of the company's operations, including hosting and porting services, Colt Online, and Voice API platforms.

The British telecommunications and network services provider disclosed that the attack started on August 12, and the disruption continues as its IT staff works around the clock to mitigate its effects.

A threat actor using the alias ‘cnkjasdfgd’ and claiming to be a member of the WarLock ransomware gang claimed the attack and offered to sell for $200,000 a batch of one million documents allegedly stolen from Colt. Several data samples have also been published to prove the validity of the files. According to the threat actor, the stolen files include financial, employee, customer, and executive data, internal emails, and software development information.
