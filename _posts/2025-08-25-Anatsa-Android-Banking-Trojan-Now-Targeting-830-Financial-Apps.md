Active since 2020, Anatsa allows its operators to take over infected devices and perform fraudulent transactions and other various actions on behalf of their victims. Last year, the trojan was seen targeting over 600 financial applications, after expanding to several European countries.

Now, it is also going after mobile users in Germany and South Korea, and is targeting over 150 new banking and cryptocurrency applications, Zscaler reports. The malware was seen being distributed through decoy applications available through the official Google Play store, some of which have amassed over 50,000 downloads.
