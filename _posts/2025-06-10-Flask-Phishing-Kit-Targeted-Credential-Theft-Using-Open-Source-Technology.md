While security teams scan for complex malware and zero-day exploits, cybercriminals are building targeted phishing attacks with the same tools sitting in your developers' GitHub repositories. Our threat team identified a campaign that utilized a Flask-based phishing kit, leveraging the popular Python web framework used by developers worldwide to build the backbone of an evasive credential theft operation.

The threat actors didn't need cutting-edge exploits or expensive infrastructure. Instead, they took freely available, open-source technology and built a versatile phishing kit with minimal technical effort. This kit enables them to launch attacks that dynamically brand themselves for each target, screen out security scanners with verification code challenges and bot detection, and exfiltrate stolen credentials through a compromised business email account.

The result? A campaign with a phishing page so convincing and well-disguised that it appears completely genuine.
