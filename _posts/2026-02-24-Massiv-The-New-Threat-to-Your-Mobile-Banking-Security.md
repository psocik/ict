## Massiv: The New Threat to Your Mobile Banking Security 🚨

Recent research performed by our Mobile Threat Intelligence (MTI) team revealed yet another Android banking Trojan, named **Massiv**. This new threat, while only seen in a limited number of targeted campaigns, poses a significant risk to mobile banking users. It allows operators to remotely control infected devices and perform **Device Takeover** attacks, leading to fraudulent transactions from victims' banking accounts.

### Key Features of Massiv 🔍
- **Overlay Functionality**: This allows the malware to display fake interfaces to trick users into providing sensitive information.
- **Keylogging**: Captures keystrokes to obtain passwords and other confidential data.
- **SMS/Push Message Interception**: Gathers sensitive data from messages.

Interestingly, one of the campaigns analyzed targeted the Portuguese government application **gov.pt**, which serves as a digital identity wallet. Criminals likely aim to use victims' details to bypass KYC verification.

### How Massiv Operates 🛠️
Massiv supports two modes of operation during a remote control session: **screen streaming** and **UI-tree mode**. The screen streaming mode shares the screen content with the remote operator, while UI-tree mode builds a structured interface model to automate interactions based on element attributes.

### Rising Threat Landscape 🌍
In the past 6-8 months, the trend of malware masquerading as IPTV applications has surged. Users seeking “premium” or region-restricted content often download these applications from unofficial sources, making them prime targets for fraudsters.

### Conclusion 🔒
Financial organizations are advised to monitor this threat closely, as it has the potential to evolve into a full-fledged **Malware-as-a-Service** model.
