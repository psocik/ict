Aviation insiders say Serbia's national airline, Air Serbia, was forced to delay issuing payslips to staff as a result of a cyberattack it is battling.\n\nInternal memos, seen by The Register, dated July 10 told staff: "Given the current situation and the ongoing cyberattacks, for security reasons, we will postpone the distribution of the June 2025 payslips.\n\nThe IT department is working to resolve the issue as a priority, and once the conditions allow, the payslips will be sent to your email addresses."\n\nStaff were reportedly paid their monthly salaries, but access to their payslip PDF was unavailable.\n\nTo read the complete article see: [The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/16/air_serbia_cyberattack/).
