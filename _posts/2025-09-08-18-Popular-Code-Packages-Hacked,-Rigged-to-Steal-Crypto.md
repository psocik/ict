At least 18 popular JavaScript code packages that are collectively downloaded more than two billion times each week were briefly compromised with malicious software, after a developer involved in maintaining the projects was phished. The attack appears to have been quickly contained and was narrowly focused on stealing cryptocurrency. But experts warn that a similar attack with a slightly more nefarious payload could lead to a disruptive malware outbreak that is far more difficult to detect and restrain.

According to Aikido, the attackers injected a piece of code that silently intercepts cryptocurrency activity in the browser, manipulates wallet interactions, and rewrites payment destinations so that funds and approvals are redirected to attacker-controlled accounts without any obvious signs to the user.

“This malware is essentially a browser-based interceptor that hijacks both network traffic and application APIs,” Aikido researcher Charlie Eriksen wrote. “What makes it dangerous is that it operates at multiple layers: altering content shown on websites, tampering with API calls, and manipulating what users’ apps believe they are signing. Even if the interface looks correct, the underlying transaction can be redirected in the background.”

Caturegli said it’s remarkable that the attackers in this case were not more ambitious or malicious with their code modifications. “The crazy part is they compromised billions of websites and apps just to target a couple of cryptocurrency things,” he said. “This was a supply chain attack, and it could easily have been something much worse than crypto harvesting.”
