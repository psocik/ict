This time it’s a “Smart Device”, or as previously mentioned on this blog an internet connected “adult only toy”.

Any electrical device usage in your home gets reported via the “smart grid”. And can be in sufficiently near “real time” detail that anyone monitoring the communications –even if they are encrypted– can see devices are being used and how.  
Think of it as “Traffic analysis” on steroids.  
But… further all usage of grid power has “a signature” that can identify the device type/model and quite often environmental factors like the temperature in the room.
