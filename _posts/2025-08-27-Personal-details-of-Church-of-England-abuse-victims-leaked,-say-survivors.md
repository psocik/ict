The personal details of almost 200 survivors of abuse in the Church of England had been leaked in a data breach from a scheme that was set up to offer them compensation, a victims' group and officials said.

The details of 194 victims were included in an email sent late on Tuesday to people who had registered for compensation, as well as to law firms and Church officials, according to The House of Survivors, a group founded by church abuse victims. It said the email was sent by the law firm which manages the redress scheme, Kennedys Law, and then recalled minutes later.
