The automaker – which owns brands including Chrysler, Jeep, and Peugeot – confirmed the data leak to Reuters, saying an unnamed third-party provider that supports its North American customer service had been pwned.

Stellantis's disclosure lands while the auto industry is already on edge. Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) confirmed earlier this month that it had been hit by a major cyberattack, which has since crippled global production and retail systems. Factories in the UK and abroad are expected to stay dark until at least September 24 while crews try to get core infrastructure back on its feet.

The company has not disclosed the nature of the attack or who was behind it, though reports point to ransomware as the likely culprit. Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters – the group linked to the M&S and Co-op intrusions over the summer – is claiming responsibility.
