Cyber specialists from Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence Directorate (HUR), with support from the “Ukrainian Cyber Alliance” and the hacker group “BO Team,” have carried out a cyberattack on the network and server infrastructure of “Haskar Integration” – one of the largest drone suppliers to the Russian armed forces, HUR sources told Kyiv Post Tuesday, July 15.  

According to the report, the operation gained access to over 47 terabytes (TB) of technical data related to the production of Russian drones after which all of the data on the manufacturer’s servers was wiped, including 10 TB of backup files.  

The cyberattack deprived the company of access to the internet, production and accounting systems were disabled, and the operations of Haskar’s development center were paralyzed. At the drone factory, all doors were remotely locked, forcing employees to exit through emergency exits.
