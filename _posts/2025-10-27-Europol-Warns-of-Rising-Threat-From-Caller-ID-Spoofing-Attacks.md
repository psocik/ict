A growing wave of caller ID spoofing attacks, in which criminals falsify the number displayed on a phone to appear legitimate, has prompted Europol to call for urgent, coordinated action across Europe.

Europol warned that organized networks have turned this into a borderless business model, offering “spoofing-as-a-service” to other offenders.

Investigators cited poor information sharing, unclear police mandates and the absence of harmonized anti-spoofing tools as major barriers.

The report identifies three top priorities for EU action:

- Harmonized technical standards to trace fraudulent calls and authenticate legitimate caller IDs.
- Enhanced cross-border collaboration among law enforcement, regulators and industry stakeholders.
- Regulatory convergence to clarify rules around caller ID use and facilitate lawful traceback requests.
