Bitdefender cybersecurity experts discovered serious vulnerabilities in Dahua smart cameras that could have allowed hackers to take full control of the devices remotely. Fortunately, the vulnerabilities have been patched, but users are urged to update their firmware to stay protected.

These cameras are widely used for surveillance in places like retail stores, warehouses, and private homes, making the security risks especially serious.

The flaws affect the firmware of the Dahua Hero C1 (DH-H4C) smart camera series.

> "The flaws, affecting the deviceâ€™s ONVIF protocol and file upload handlers, allow unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary commands remotely, effectively taking over the device." reads the advisory published by the cybersecurity firm.

> "The vulnerabilities were reported to Dahua for responsible mitigation and disclosure and are now patched at the time of publication."
