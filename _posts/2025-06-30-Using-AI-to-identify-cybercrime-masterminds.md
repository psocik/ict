Online criminal forums, both on the public internet and on the “dark web” of Tor .onion sites, are a rich resource for threat intelligence researchers. The Sophos Counter Threat Unit (CTU) has a team of darkweb researchers collecting intelligence and interacting with darkweb forums, but combing through these posts is a time-consuming and resource-intensive task, and it’s always possible that things are missed.

As we strive to make better use of AI and data analysis, Sophos AI researcher Francois Labreche, working with Estelle Ruellan of Flare and the Université de Montréal and Masarah Paquet-Clouston of the Université de Montréal, set out to see if they could approach the problem of identifying key actors on the dark web in a more automated way. Their work, originally presented at the 2024 APWG Symposium on Electronic Crime Research, has recently been published as a paper.
