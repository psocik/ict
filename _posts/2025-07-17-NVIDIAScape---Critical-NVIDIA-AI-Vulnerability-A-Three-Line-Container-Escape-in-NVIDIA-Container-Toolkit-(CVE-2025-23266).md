Wiz Research discovered a critical container escape vulnerability in the NVIDIA Container Toolkit (NCT), which we've dubbed **#NVIDIAScape**. This toolkit powers many AI services offered by cloud and SaaS providers, and the vulnerability, now tracked as CVE-2025-23266, has been assigned a **CVSS score of 9.0 (Critical)**. It allows a malicious container to bypass isolation measures and gain full root access to the host machine. This flaw stems from a subtle misconfiguration in how the toolkit handles OCI hooks, and it can be exploited with a stunningly simple three-line Dockerfile.

The danger of this vulnerability is most acute in managed AI cloud services that allow customers to run their own AI containers on shared GPU infrastructure. In this scenario, a malicious customer could use this vulnerability to run a specially crafted container, escape its intended boundaries, and achieve full root control of the host machine. From there, the attacker could access, steal, or manipulate the sensitive data and proprietary models of all other customers running on the same shared hardware.
