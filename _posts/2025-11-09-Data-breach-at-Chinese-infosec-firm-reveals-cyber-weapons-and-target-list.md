Chinese infosec blog MXRN last week reported a data breach at a security company called Knownsec that has ties to Beijing and China's military. MXRN says the company leaked over 12,000 classified documents, including information on Chinese state-owned cyber weapons, internal tools, and global target lists.

The trove also apparently included evidence of Remote Access Trojans that can crack Linux, Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android. The Android code can reportedly extract information from popular Chinese messaging apps and from Telegram.

Also in the haul was a spreadsheet that lists 80 overseas targets Knownsec has successfully attacked, plus 95GB of immigration data obtained from India, 3TB of call records stolen from South Korean telecom operator LG U Plus, and 459GB of road planning data obtained from Taiwan.
