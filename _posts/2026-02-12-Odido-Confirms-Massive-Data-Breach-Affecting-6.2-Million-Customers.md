## Major Data Breach at Odido 🚨

Odido, a prominent Dutch telecom firm, has confirmed a massive data breach affecting **6.2 million customers**. Hackers gained unauthorized access to sensitive data, including names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, bank account details, dates of birth, and passport or ID numbers. 

The company stated, "Odido has been hit by a cyberattack, which compromised customer data. This involved personal data from a customer contact system used by Odido. No passwords, call logs, or billing information were affected." 

### What Happened? 🤔

The breach was detected last weekend, and Odido promptly reported it to the Dutch privacy watchdog. The unauthorized access was terminated swiftly, and external cybersecurity experts have been engaged to enhance security measures. 

### Customer Advisory ⚠️

Odido urges customers to remain vigilant for suspicious activities. Criminals may exploit stolen information to impersonate Odido or other companies through calls, texts, or emails. Here are some safety tips:
- Avoid clicking on unknown links.
- Verify unexpected calls by contacting the company directly using official numbers.
- Never share passwords or PINs.
- Review invoices closely for any fake payment requests.
