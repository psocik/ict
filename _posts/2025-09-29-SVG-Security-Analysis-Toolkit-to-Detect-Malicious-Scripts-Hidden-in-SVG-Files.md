The SVG Security Analysis Toolkit by HackingLZ offers a comprehensive [OPEN SOURCE] solution: a suite of four Python-based tools designed to reveal hidden scripts, decode obfuscated URLs, and verify protection mechanisms, all without exposing analysts to unsafe execution environments.

To complete the analysis workflow, the toolkit includes cf_probe.py and encoder.py. The cf_probe.py is a Cloudflare Protection Detection program that scans HTTP and meta-refresh redirects for Cloudflare challenges.
