BIETA and its subsidiary, Beijing Sanxin Times Technology Co., Ltd. (CIII), research, develop, import, and sell technologies that almost certainly support intelligence, counterintelligence, military, and other missions relevant to China's national development and security. Their activities include researching methods of steganography that can likely support covert communications (COVCOM) and malware deployment; developing and selling forensic investigation and counterintelligence equipment; and acquiring foreign technologies for steganography, network penetration testing, and military communications and planning.

As recently as November 2021, the company has worked on a tool named Intelligent Discussion Android App and a cell phone positioning system that can identify, monitor, position, and block mobile phones within large venues, including the ability to harvest text messages and calls from phones under their control.

The Mastercard-owned company noted both BIETA and CIII "almost certainly" are part of a set of front organizations that contribute to the development of tools to facilitate cyber-enabled intelligence operations by Beijing's intelligence apparatus and its proxies.
