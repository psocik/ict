Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has stated that an internal data breach affecting nearly 70,000 users involved bribed contractors from India.

The initial report from Coinbase said the data breach could be attributed to the misconduct of a small group of external contractors; however, it turned out to be a more complex problem.

The crypto exchange confirmed that a coordinated bribery scheme had been directed at its overseas customer support team, leading to the leak of personal and financial data. The company said it reported the breach to police and launched a $20 million reward fund to get information on the attackers.
