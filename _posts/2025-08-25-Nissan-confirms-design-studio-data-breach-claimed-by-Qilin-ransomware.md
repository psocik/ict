Qilin ransomware added CBI on its extortion portal on the dark web on August 20, 2025, claiming to have stolen all design projects and threatening to make them public, giving competitors an edge.

The threat actors also published 16 photos of the stolen data as evidence of their claims, which depict 3D car designs, spreadsheets, documents, and car interior images.

Qilin ransomware has been very active this year, claiming high-profile victims such as the Lee Enterprises publishing group and the pharmaceutical firm Inotiv.

The threat actors were linked to the exploitation of the Kickidler employee monitoring tool and two Fortinet vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-21762, CVE-2024-55591), which enabled them to remotely execute code on devices without authentication.
