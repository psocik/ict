### Key takeaways

Not long after its takedown in May, Lumma Stealer is back. From June to July, the number of targeted accounts began resurging. Now, the malware is distributed with more discreet channels and stealthier evasion tactics.

With its information-stealing capabilities, Lumma Stealer can siphon sensitive data such as credentials and private files. Also, as the threat is marketed as a malware-as-a-service (MaaS), even cybercriminals with little to no technical knowledge can wield this malware.
