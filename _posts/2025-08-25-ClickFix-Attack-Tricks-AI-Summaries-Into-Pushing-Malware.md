A new ClickFix social engineering proof-of-concept attack uses AI summaries to deliver ransomware.

Threat monitoring vendor CloudSEK published research today regarding a ClickFix proof-of-concept (POC) exploit. ClickFix is an increasingly popular social engineering tactic in which an attacker displays an error message or call to action instructing the target to execute self-sabotaging commands.

CloudSEK vulnerability researcher Dharani Sanjaiy, who authored a blog post covering the research, explained that an attacker would begin by crafting HTML content such as a web page, blog post, or email. While the content the visitor/reader sees would otherwise look benign, the content would include "tricks" like white-on-white text, zero-width characters, tiny font sizes, off-screen text positioning, and so on in order to hide malicious code. Malicious code would be pasted repeatedly, overloading AI models that view the content so the payload would be prioritized in AI summaries.
