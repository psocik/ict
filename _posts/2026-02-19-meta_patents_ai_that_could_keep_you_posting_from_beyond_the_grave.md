## Meta Patents AI That Could Keep You Posting From Beyond The Grave 🚀

On December 30, 2025, Meta was granted US patent 12513102B2: **Simulation of a user of a social networking system using a language model**. This innovative system trains an AI on a user’s posts, comments, chats, voice messages, and likes, enabling a bot to respond to newsfeeds, DMs, and even simulate audio or video calls. Filed in November 2023 by Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth, this patent aims to allow users to engage with their social networks even after they are gone.

From the patent: “The language model may be used for simulating the user when the user is absent from the social networking system, for example, when the user takes a long break or if the user is deceased.”

A Meta spokesperson informed **Business Insider** that the company currently has no plans to implement this patent. If they ever decide to pursue this technology, it would mark a significant shift from their existing memorialization policy, which preserves accounts without alterations.

Other companies have explored similar concepts. For instance, Microsoft patented a chatbot that would allow conversations with AI versions of deceased individuals in 2020, but it was never put into production due to concerns about its implications. Amazon even demonstrated Alexa mimicking a deceased grandmother’s voice using under a minute of audio in 2022, but that project also did not launch.

Legal questions may also pose challenges for Meta. There is currently no uniform US framework regarding the use of AI to represent the deceased. Some states recognize post-mortem rights of publicity, while others, like California, have specific laws targeting AI-generated impersonations of the deceased. Additionally, the EU AI Act’s Article 50, effective this August, will require AI systems to disclose their nature, with significant penalties for non-compliance.
