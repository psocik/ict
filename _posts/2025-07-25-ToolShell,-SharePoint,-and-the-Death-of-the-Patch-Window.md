## Introduction

This week’s zero-day exploit targeting Microsoft SharePoint, now referred to as ToolShell, caught organizations off guard. The exploit allowed unauthenticated remote code execution and quickly spread across unpatched SharePoint servers. Moreover, this incorporated a variant of previous vulnerabilities and resulted in the exploitation of an unpatched vulnerability.  

While this scenario is a security team’s nightmare (the mass exploitation of a zero-day), it does highlight a trend we’ve been monitoring for several years - evidence of exploitation within Team Cymru’s data holdings prior to the availability of public exploit code. This type of insight is critical for defenders to be highly tuned into, because it demonstrates how fast and agile attackers have become and why they need to evolve their exposure discovery and related workflows to avert disaster.
