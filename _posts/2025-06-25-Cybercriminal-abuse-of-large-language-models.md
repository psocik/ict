Cybercriminals are continuing to explore artificial intelligence (AI) technologies such as large language models (LLMs) to aid in their criminal hacking activities.

Some cybercriminals have resorted to using uncensored LLMs or even custom-built criminal LLMs for illicit purposes.

Advertised features of malicious LLMs indicate that cybercriminals are connecting these systems to various external tools for sending outbound email, scanning sites for vulnerabilities, verifying stolen credit card numbers, and more.

Cybercriminals also abuse legitimate AI technology, such as jailbreaking legitimate LLMs, to aid in their operations.
