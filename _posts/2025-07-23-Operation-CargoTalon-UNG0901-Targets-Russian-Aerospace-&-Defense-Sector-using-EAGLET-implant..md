SEQRITE Labs APT-Team has recently found a campaign targeting the Russian Aerospace Industry. The campaign aims at employees of Voronezh Aircraft Production Association (VASO), a significant aircraft production entity in Russia, using товарно-транспортная накладная (TTN) documents, which are critical to Russian logistics operations.
