New research has found that organizations in various sensitive sectors, including governments, telecoms, and critical infrastructure, are pasting passwords and credentials into online tools like JSONformatter and CodeBeautify that are used to format and validate code.

Cybersecurity company watchTowr Labs said it captured a dataset of over 80,000 files on these sites, uncovering thousands of usernames, passwords, repository authentication keys, Active Directory credentials, database credentials, FTP credentials, cloud environment keys, LDAP configuration information, helpdesk API keys, meeting room API keys, SSH session recordings, and all kinds of personal information.

To make matters worse, the company said it uploaded fake AWS access keys to one of these tools and found bad actors attempting to abuse them 48 hours after they were saved. This indicates that valuable information exposed through these sources is being scraped by other parties and tested, posing severe risks.
