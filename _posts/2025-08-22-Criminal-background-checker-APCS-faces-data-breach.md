Exclusive: A leading UK provider of criminal record checks for employers is handling a data breach stemming from a third-party development company. Access Personal Checking Services (APCS) has written to customers to notify them that their data has been compromised, according to emails seen by The Register, and it confirmed to us that Hull-based Intradev was the organization initially attacked.

APCS describes itself as the UK's fastest service for carrying out Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks, which were known as Criminal Record Bureau checks prior to 2012. Organizations use them for roles that require background screening, such as jobs that involve working with children or vulnerable individuals, as well as in the healthcare and financial services sectors.

Asked whether the attack involved ransomware, Cheetham neither confirmed nor denied. "During the incident, certain files were affected," he said. "We are continuing to investigate the nature of this activity and its potential impact. Attribution is not yet confirmed."
