### Introduction

As members of the Global Emergency Response Team (GERT), we work with forensic artifacts on a daily basis to conduct investigations, and one of the most valuable artifacts is UserAssist. It contains useful execution information that helps us determine and track adversarial activities, and reveal malware samples. However, UserAssist has not been extensively examined, leaving knowledge gaps regarding its data interpretation, logging conditions and triggers, among other things. This article provides an in-depth analysis of the UserAssist artifact, clarifying any ambiguity in its data representation. We’ll discuss the creation and updating of artifact workflow, the UEME_CTLSESSION value structure and its role in logging the UserAssist data. We’ll also introduce the UserAssist data structure that was previously unknown.
