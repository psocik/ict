Generative AI and LLM technologies have shown great potential in recent years, and for this reason, an increasing number of applications are starting to integrate them for multiple purposes. These applications are becoming increasingly complex, adopting approaches that involve multiple specialized agents, each focused on one or more tasks, interacting with one another and using external tools to access information, perform operations, or carry out tasks that LLMs are not capable of handling directly (e.g., mathematical computations).

From an offensive perspective, things start to get interesting when these applications have access to databases, protected information, internal tools, or external resources.

But let’s start from the beginning. What is an LLM? If we ask this question to ChatGPT we get the following response:

A Large Language Model is a type of artificial intelligence model trained on massive amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language. These models use deep learning techniques, particularly transformer architectures, to perform tasks such as answering questions, translating languages, summarizing text, and generating coherent and contextually relevant responses.
