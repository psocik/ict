Stanford University has unveiled ARTEMIS, an autonomous AI agent platform designed for penetration testing, which recently underwent rigorous evaluation against human cybersecurity professionals and other AI systems. In a challenge conducted on a live enterprise environment comprising approximately 8,000 hosts across 12 subnets, ARTEMIS showcased remarkable capabilities. The platform successfully outperformed nine out of ten human participants and several other agentic AI platforms in discovering vulnerabilities. Beyond its technical prowess, the study highlighted ARTEMIS's significant cost efficiency, estimated at $18 per hour compared to a human penetration tester's $60 per hour. Its technical sophistication and submission quality were deemed comparable to the strongest participants, suggesting a shift in red teaming methodologies.

The diverse university network, featuring Unix, IoT, Windows, and embedded systems, was secured by standard protections. ARTEMIS was evaluated in two configurations, with its multi-agent setup, utilizing an ensemble of supervisor models including Claude Sonnet 4, OpenAI o3, Claude Opus 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and OpenAI o3 Pro for sub-agents, proving most effective. This configuration discovered nine valid vulnerabilities (82% valid submission rate), securing second place overall. While the top human participant identified 13 vulnerabilities, ARTEMIS significantly outstripped other AI systems like OpenAI’s Codex and Claude Code, many of which failed to sustain the 10-hour test.

ARTEMIS demonstrated particular strength in command-line interface (CLI) dependent testing where graphical user interfaces (GUIs) were unavailable. It notably found vulnerabilities humans missed, such as a flaw in an older IDRAC server with an outdated HTTPS cipher suite, a scenario where 60% of humans found issues in a modern web interface IDRAC but not the older version. Conversely, the AI system struggled with GUI-based interactions, overlooking a critical remote code execution vulnerability on a Windows machine accessible via TinyPilot, instead submitting misconfigurations like CORS wildcard and cookie flags. The platform also demonstrated a higher propensity for false positives. This indicates that while AI can identify blind spots, human expertise remains crucial for complex, interactive, and nuanced vulnerability discovery.

Developed by the Stanford Trinity project, ARTEMIS (Automated Red Teaming Engine with Multi-agent Intelligent Supervision) is openly available on GitHub. Its architecture comprises a supervisor managing workflow, a swarm of sub-agents, and a triager for verification, leveraging current coding AI agents. To operate over extended periods, ARTEMIS uses a task list, note-taking system, and smart summarization, splitting work into sessions to manage context. During the study, it peaked at eight active sub-agents, averaging 2.82 concurrent agents per supervisor iteration. While the 10-hour test duration is a limitation compared to typical multi-week penetration tests, the study underscores AI's accelerating potential to augment cybersecurity defenses, particularly in automating initial reconnaissance and finding specific flaws, while highlighting areas where human ingenuity remains indispensable.
