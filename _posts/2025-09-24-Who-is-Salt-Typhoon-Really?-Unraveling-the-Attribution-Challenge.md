Our previous post about Salt Typhoon provided an initial commentary on the Joint Cybersecurity Advisory on Salt Typhoon issued on August 27, 2025. The advisory identified three Chinese companies - Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology Co. Ltd. (四川聚信和网络科技有限公司), Beijing Huanyu Tianqiong Information Technology Co., Ltd. (北京寰宇天穹信息技术有限公司), and Sichuan Zhixin Ruijie Network Technology Co., Ltd. (四川智信锐捷网络科技有限公司) - as suppliers of products and services to Salt Typhoon and other overlapping groups such as OPERATOR PANDA, RedMike, UNC5807, and GhostEmperor.
