One of the recent discoveries made by ThreatFabric's analysts continues this trend. In this report we introduce PhantomCard - a new Android NFC-based Trojan targeting banking customers in Brazil and potentially expanding globally. Key takeaways are:

- PhantomCard relays NFC data from victim's banking card to fraudster's device.
- PhantomCard is based on Chinese-originating NFC relay Malware-as-a-Service.
- The actor behind the malware is a "serial" reseller of Android threats active in Brazil.
- PhantomCard is delivered via fake "Google Play" web-pages mimicking apps for "card protection".
