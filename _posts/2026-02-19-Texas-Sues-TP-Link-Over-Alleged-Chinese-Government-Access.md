## Texas Sues TP-Link

Texas has filed a lawsuit against TP-Link Systems, alleging that the company has deceptively marketed its networking devices and allowed the Chinese government to access American consumers' devices. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton stated, **"Despite its claims of privacy and security, TP-Link’s products have been used by China’s state-sponsored hacking entities to launch multiple cyber-attack operations against the United States."**

He emphasized that TP-Link's actions pose a national security threat, enabling secret surveillance of Texas consumers. 

TP-Link, a California-based router manufacturer, has denied these allegations, asserting that the Chinese government has no ownership or control over the company. They claim that the lawsuit is **"without merit and will be proven false,"** highlighting that all core operations are based in the United States and user data is stored securely on Amazon Web Services servers.

This lawsuit follows an investigation initiated in October and is part of a broader series of actions against companies associated with China. Additionally, Texas has prohibited its employees from using TP-Link devices, reflecting growing concerns over cybersecurity and foreign influence.
