Logins.zip operates as a browser-based builder, allowing operators to generate custom malware stubs without technical expertise. Once deployed, the stub which is clocking in at a mere ~150KB employs polymorphic auto-obfuscation to dodge static detection.

**Key features include:**

- **Full Credential Harvesting**: Bypasses User Account Control (UAC) and combines DPAPI with direct exploitation of two undisclosed Chromium security flaws, all in userland for stealth and compatibility. No admin privileges required.
- **Broad Target Coverage**: Supports Chrome, Brave, Edge, Firefox, Opera, and more. Extracts logins (URL:username:password format), cookies (nested by browser/profile), autofills, and even credit cards (JSON format).
- **Specialized Modules**: Discord token harvesting with auto-verification, Roblox cookie extraction, and emerging crypto wallet support (daily auto-updates incoming). Metadata JSON provides collection stats for triage.
- **Exfiltration and Persistence**: Seamless integration with Discord or Telegram bots for data dumps. Advanced anti-sandbox, anti-debugging, and EDR-evasive process injection via direct syscalls with runtime resolution.
