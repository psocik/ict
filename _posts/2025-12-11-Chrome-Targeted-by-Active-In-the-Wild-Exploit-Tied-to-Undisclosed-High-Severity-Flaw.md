Google on Wednesday shipped security updates for its Chrome browser to address three security flaws, including one it said has come under active exploitation in the wild.

However, a GitHub commit for the Chromium bug ID has revealed that the issue resides in Google's open-source Almost Native Graphics Layer Engine (ANGLE) library, with the commit message stating *"Metal: Don't use pixelsDepthPitch to size buffers. pixelsDepthPitch is based on GL_UNPACK_IMAGE_HEIGHT, which can be smaller than the image height."*

This indicates the problem is likely a buffer overflow vulnerability in ANGLE's Metal renderer triggered by improper buffer sizing, which could lead to memory corruption, program crashes, or arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability, rated high in severity, is being tracked under the Chromium issue tracker ID "466192044." Unlike other disclosures, Google has opted to keep information about the CVE identifier, the affected component, and the nature of the flaw under wraps.
