**Excerpt:**  
"You’ve decided to build a network over the weekend. Why, you ask? Because you can.  
  
Saturday morning comes, and you’re sitting there (naturally, Bambi is by your side) building your network. "What should I use to help secure my environment and access to it?” you ponder. Obviously, because you lack individual thought, you type your question into ChatGPT - “You’re in luck, there’s an entire industry that builds enterprise-grade, enterprise-priced secure remote access appliances!”  
  
“Brilliant” you say while smirking before deploying your chosen solution, patting yourself on the back and moving on to other things. “Isn’t it nice to be able to do such things so securely?” you ponder to yourself.  
  
Then you wake up and realise:
