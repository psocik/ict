## DOGE May Have Misused Social Security Data, DOJ Admits 🚨

The Trump administration recently acknowledged in court documents that operatives from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) may have improperly shared data from the Social Security Administration (SSA) with an external group aiming to overturn election results in certain states. This revelation comes from a January 16 filing by the Department of Justice (DOJ).

However, the DOJ remains uncertain whether the unnamed members of the "DOGE Team" actually shared the data with the unidentified group. The filing seeks to correct previous testimony and indicates that DOGE operatives were using links to share data via the third-party server 'Cloudflare,' which is not approved for storing SSA data and violates SSA's security protocols.

Additionally, the filing mentions that Steve Davis, a senior adviser to Elon Musk, was included in a March 3, 2025, email that contained a password-protected file with the names and addresses of approximately 1,000 individuals, extracted from SSA records. As of the court filing date, the SSA could not confirm whether Davis accessed the file, which remained inaccessible to current SSA employees.

In related news, a researcher uncovered an unsecured database with 149 million login credentials linked to various accounts, including Gmail, Facebook, and Apple, as well as government systems worldwide. The researcher, Jeremiah Fowler, suspects that the stolen logins were gathered by infostealing malware. Fortunately, the database has since been taken offline.

Moreover, Under Armour is investigating a potential data breach after a hacker leaked millions of customer records online. The data breach notification site 'Have I Been Pwned' has alerted 72 million individuals via email about the leak, which included names, email addresses, genders, dates of birth, approximate locations, and purchase information. An Under Armour spokesperson stated that the company is aware of the claims regarding the breach and has engaged external cybersecurity experts for assistance.

In another incident, a hacking operation hijacked Iranian state TV's satellite to broadcast an anti-regime protest message this week. The clip featured the son of Iran's former ruler, Reza Pahlavi, urging military and security forces to join the protesters against the regime. Reports indicate that the unauthorized message aired for up to 10 minutes before the state TV resumed its regular programming.

Lastly, Microsoft confirmed that it frequently provides Bitlocker encryption keys to law enforcement upon request, granting them full access to a machine's secrets. The company receives about 20 requests for Bitlocker keys annually and often complies, although it cannot do so if the key is stored only locally by the user.
