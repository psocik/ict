**Summary**  
Keir Giles, a prominent expert on Russian information operations, was targeted with a sophisticated and personalized novel social engineering attack.  
The attacker took extensive measures to avoid raising Mr. Giles’ suspicions and deceived him into creating and sending them App-Specific Passwords for his accounts, bypassing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).  
Google later spotted and blocked the attacker. Their Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) labels the operator Russian state-backed UNC6293, which they link with low confidence to APT29, which is attributed to Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR).  
We expect more social engineering attacks leveraging App-Specific Passwords in the future.
