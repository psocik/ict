**Summary:**  
SIM swap fraud, where a criminal takes control of your mobile number, is a rapidly growing threat. In the UK, unauthorized SIM swap fraud cases rose by 1,055%, from 289 in 2023 to nearly 3,000 in 2024. This highlights vulnerabilities in corporate security, as attackers manipulate mobile numbers to gain access to sensitive accounts.
  
**Details:**  
Criminals often claim to have lost their phones or that they need to activate a new SIM. If successful, they take control of the victim's number, rendering the victim unable to make calls or receive texts. The attackers then intercept crucial information like passwords and account recovery links, leading to unauthorized access and potential financial losses.
