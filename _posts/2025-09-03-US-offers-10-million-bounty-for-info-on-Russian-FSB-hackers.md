The U.S. Department of State is offering a reward of up to $10 million for information on three Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) officers involved in cyberattacks targeting U.S. critical infrastructure organizations on behalf of the Russian government.

The three individuals, Marat Valeryevich Tyukov, Mikhail Mikhailovich Gavrilov, and Pavel Aleksandrovich Akulov, are part of the FSB's Center 16 or Military Unit 71330, which is tracked as Berserk Bear, Blue Kraken, Crouching Yeti, Dragonfly, and Koala Team.

More recently, as the FBI warned in August, they exploited the CVE-2018-0171 vulnerability in end-of-life Cisco networking devices over the past year to breach companies across U.S. critical infrastructure sectors by remotely executing arbitrary code on unpatched devices.
