In this article, we’ll uncover an entire North Korean infiltration operation aimed at deploying remote IT workers across different companies in the American financial and crypto/Web3 sectors, with the objective of conducting corporate espionage and generating funding for the sanctioned regime. We attributed this effort to the state-sponsored APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) Lazarus, specifically the Famous Chollima division.

### Key Takeaways 

- North Korean operators are infiltrating companies by posing as remote IT workers and using stolen or rented identities.  
- Famous Chollima relies on social engineering, not advanced malware; convincing stories, pressure, and identity fraud drive the operation.  
- Recruitment is wide-scale, using GitHub spam, Telegram outreach, and fake job-seeking setups.  
- Victims are pushed to hand over full identity data, including SSNs, bank accounts, and device access.  
- Extended ANY.RUN sandbox environments enabled real-time monitoring, capturing every click, file action, and network request.  
- Operators used a predictable toolkit, including AnyDesk, Google Remote Desktop, AI-based interview helpers, and OTP extensions.  
- Shared infrastructure and repeated mistakes revealed their poor operational security and overlapping roles.  
- Controlled crashes and resets kept them contained, preventing any real malicious activity while intelligence was gathered.

The investigation provides a rare inside view of how these operatives work, communicate, and attempt to maintain access.
