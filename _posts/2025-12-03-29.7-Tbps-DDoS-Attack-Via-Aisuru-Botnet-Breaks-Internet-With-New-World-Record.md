A new 29.7 Tbps distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) blast from the Aisuru botnet has set a new world record for attack volume, underscoring how fragile core internet infrastructure remains under extreme load.

The attack used a UDP "carpet bombing" technique that hammered roughly 15,000 destination ports per second while randomizing packet attributes to slip past static filtering and legacy scrubbing centers.

Behind this record is a botnet that Cloudflare now estimates at roughly 1–4 million compromised devices worldwide, making Aisuru the dominant DDoS botnet in the current threat ecosystem. Portions of the botnet are openly brokered as "chunks" for hire, meaning would-be attackers can rent enough capacity to saturate backbone links or cripple national ISPs for only a few hundred to a few thousand dollars.

At the extreme end, incidents exceeding 100 million packets per second jumped 189% QoQ, and those above 1 Tbps grew 227%, yet the majority of these barrages ended within 10 minutes, too fast for manual response or on-demand mitigation contracts to reliably catch.
