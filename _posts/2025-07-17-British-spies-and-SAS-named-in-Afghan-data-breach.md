The identities of more than 100 British officials, including members of the special forces and MI6, were compromised in a data breach that also put thousands of Afghans at risk of reprisal, it can be reported.\n\nThe latest fallout from the breach was kept secret by an injunction until Thursday, when the order was lifted in part by a High Court judge.\n\nThat allowed media organisations to reveal that detailed case notes in the database contained secret personal data of special forces and spies.\n\nThe government had already admitted on Tuesday the data of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had worked with the British during the 20-year war in Afghanistan and had applied to resettle in the UK had been inadvertently leaked.\n\nTo read the complete article see: [BBC Article](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4ek9njknvo)
