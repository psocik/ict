## UFP Technologies Discloses Data Breach After Cybersecurity Incident 🚨

UFP Technologies, a prominent American manufacturer of critical medical devices, has recently confirmed a significant cybersecurity incident. This serious event has compromised its core IT systems and sensitive data. The company, which specializes in components for surgical, wound care, implant, and wearable medical applications, detected unauthorized activity on **February 14**. This initial detection prompted an immediate internal response.

The reported breach severely impacted various key IT systems, affecting crucial operational functions such as billing and label creation for customer deliveries. While UFP Technologies currently believes the threat actor has been effectively removed and system access largely restored, the ongoing investigation indicates that some company or company-related data was stolen or potentially destroyed. This specific finding suggests a possible ransomware or wiper attack. Furthermore, the company has proactively engaged external cybersecurity experts to aid in the comprehensive ongoing investigation into the matter. As of now, no ransomware group has publicly claimed responsibility for the incident.

UFP Technologies is diligently assessing whether personal information was exfiltrated during the course of the attack and will issue notifications if confirmed, strictly adhering to all legal requirements. Despite the confirmed breach, the company's primary IT systems remain fully operational, and it currently anticipates no material impact on its overall operations or financial performance. This developing situation continues to be monitored closely for further updates.
