This time, we’re looking at Fortinet’s FortiWeb Fabric Connector. “What is that?” we hear you say. That's a great question; no one knows.

For the uninitiated, or unjaded: Fortinet’s FortiWeb Fabric Connector is meant to be the glue between FortiWeb (their web application firewall) and other Fortinet ecosystem products, allowing for dynamic, policy-based security updates based on real-time changes in infrastructure or threat posture. Think of it as a fancy middleman - pulling metadata from sources like FortiGate firewalls, FortiManager, or even external services like AWS, and feeding that into FortiWeb so it can automatically adjust its protections. In theory, it should make things smarter and more responsive.

If you can’t tell, we moonlight inside Fortinet’s Presales Engineering team - the circle of life is very much real in cybersecurity.

Anyway, today, we’re analysing CVE-2025-25257 - a friendly pre-auth SQL injection in FortiWeb Fabric Connector, which, as described above, is the glue between many Fortinet security solutions. Sigh….
