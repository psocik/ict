A major data exposure linked to NetcoreCloud, an India-based global email marketing and automation company, has drawn attention after cybersecurity researcher Jeremiah Fowler found a publicly accessible database containing more than 40 billion records. The 13.4 terabytes of data was left unprotected and unencrypted, giving anyone with access to its IP address a direct view into a massive amount of email communication records.

Fowler said the database appeared to contain mail logs and marketing data that included email addresses, message subjects, and internal delivery information. Among the files, he found healthcare notifications, banking activity alerts, and employment-related emails.

Some records contained partial account details and technical information like IP addresses and SMTP configuration data that were never meant to be public. Several entries were even labeled as confidential.

The risk in an exposure of this scale goes beyond email spam or unwanted marketing messages. Fowler explained that detailed mail logs and recipient information can help cybercriminals understand how companies communicate, what services their customers use, and even the timing of financial transactions. That knowledge can be exploited for targeted phishing or social engineering campaigns that mimic legitimate business interactions.
