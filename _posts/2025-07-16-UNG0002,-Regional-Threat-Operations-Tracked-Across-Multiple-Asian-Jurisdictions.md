- **ClickFix Social Engineering:** The group utilizes fake CAPTCHA verification pages to trick victims into executing malicious PowerShell scripts, notably spoofing Pakistanâ€™s Ministry of Maritime Affairs website.
  
- **Abusing DLL Sideloading:** In the recent campaign, consistent abuse of legitimate Windows applications (Rasphone, Node-Webkit) for DLL sideloading to execute malicious payloads while evading detection.
  
- **CV-Themed Decoy Documents:** Use of realistic resume documents targeting specific industries, including fake profiles of game UI designers and computer science students from prestigious institutions.
  
- **Persistent Infrastructure:** Maintained command and control infrastructure with consistent naming patterns and operational security across multiple campaigns spanning over a year.
