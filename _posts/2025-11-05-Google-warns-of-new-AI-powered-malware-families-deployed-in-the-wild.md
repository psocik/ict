Google's Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) has identified a major shift this year, with adversaries leveraging artificial intelligence to deploy new malware families that integrate large language models (LLMs) during execution.

This new approach enables dynamic altering mid-execution, which reaches new levels of operational versatility that are virtually impossible to achieve with traditional malware.

Google calls the technique "just-in-time" self-modification and highlights the experimental PromptFlux malware dropper and the PromptSteal (a.k.a. LameHug) data miner deployed in Ukraine, as examples for dynamic script generation, code obfuscation, and creation of on-demand functions.

"The most novel component of PROMPTFLUX is its 'Thinking Robot' module, designed to periodically query Gemini to obtain new code for evading antivirus software," explains Google.
