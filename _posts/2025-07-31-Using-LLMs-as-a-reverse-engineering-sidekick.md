This research explores how large language models (LLMs) can complement, rather than replace, the efforts of malware analysts in the complex field of reverse engineering.  

LLMs may serve as powerful assistants to streamline workflows, enhance efficiency, and provide actionable insights during malware analysis.  

We will showcase practical applications of LLMs in conjunction with essential tools like Model Context Protocol (MCP) frameworks and industry-standard disassemblers and decompilers, such as IDA Pro and Ghidra.  

Readers will gain insights into which models and tools are best suited for common challenges in malware analysis and how these tools can accelerate the identification and understanding of unknown malicious files.  

We also show how some common hurdles faced when using LLMs may influence the results, like cost increases due to tool usage and limitations of input context size in local models.
