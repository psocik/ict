Microsoft Corp. today issued security updates to fix more than 80 vulnerabilities in its Windows operating systems and software. There are no known "zero-day" or actively exploited vulnerabilities in this month’s bundle from Redmond, which nevertheless includes patches for 13 flaws that earned Microsoft’s most-dire "critical" label.

Microsoft assigns security flaws a "critical" rating when malware or miscreants can exploit them to gain remote access to a Windows system with little or no help from users. Among the more concerning critical bugs quashed this month is CVE-2025-54918. The problem here resides with Windows NTLM, or NT LAN Manager, a suite of code for managing authentication in a Windows network environment.

"From Microsoft’s limited description, it appears that if an attacker is able to send specially crafted packets over the network to the target device, they would have the ability to gain SYSTEM-level privileges on the target machine," Breen said. "The patch notes for this vulnerability state that 'Improper authentication in Windows NTLM allows an authorized attacker to elevate privileges over a network,' suggesting an attacker may already need to have access to the NTLM hash or the user’s credentials."
