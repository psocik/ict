Zimperium’s zLabs research team has uncovered a new variant of the Hook Android banking trojan, now featuring some of the most advanced capabilities we’ve seen to date. This version introduces:

- Ransomware-style overlays that display extortion messages
- Fake NFC overlays to trick victims into sharing sensitive data
- Lockscreen bypass via deceptive PIN and pattern prompts
- Transparent overlays to silently capture user gestures
- Stealthy screen-streaming sessions for real-time monitoring

In total, the malware now supports 107 remote commands — with 38 newly added in this update.
