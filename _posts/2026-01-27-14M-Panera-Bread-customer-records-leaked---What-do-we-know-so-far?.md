Hackers have claimed responsibility for a cyberattack against Panera Bread, a major American restaurant chain, that allegedly resulted in the leak of millions of customer and employee records. The Panera data breach was claimed by the ShinyHunters cyber cartel, after the gang posted the company on its dark web forum. The attackers claim they have access to a whopping 14 million records containing personally identifiable information (PII). Panera Bread is a major casual restaurant chain in North America, with over 2,000 locations in the US and Canada.

Meanwhile, the Cybernews research team investigated the data sample that the attackers attached to their dark web post. According to the team, the leaked Panera Bread data breach details include employee and customer information, such as full names, usernames, work emails, personal emails, phone numbers, home addresses, and dates of birth.

Our researchers believe that malicious actors could utilize the data to target exposed individuals. For one, attackers could exploit the data leak for identity theft, using stolen names and other personal details to set up fraudulent accounts or submit fraudulent tax claims. Additionally, malicious actors could use Panera Bread employee emails to impersonate the company and target its customers. For example, attackers could distribute phishing emails that peddle malware.

Panera Bread’s supposed attackers, the ShinyHunters gang, are among the most aggressive cybergangs currently operating. The cybercrime collective was previously linked to multiple high-profile breaches and large-scale data theft campaigns, including last year’s Salesforce CRM data heist. The cyberattack on Salesforce enabled numerous large-scale data thefts across hundreds of organizations, including big names ranging from Jaguar Land Rover, Gucci, and Chanel to Cisco Systems and Google. Large restaurant chains like Panera Bread interest attackers due to the large volumes of customer and employee data they house. For example, last week Everest ransomware group claimed a McDonald's data breach.
