In a recent incident response (IR) case, we discovered highly customized malware targeting Exchange infrastructure within government environments. Analysis of detection logs and clues within the sample suggests that the Exchange server was likely compromised via a known N-day vulnerability. Our in-depth analysis of the malware revealed a sophisticated, multi-functional backdoor that can be dynamically extended with arbitrary functionality through the download of additional modules. Notably, the attackers leveraged several open-source projects to build this backdoor. Once loaded, the backdoor grants the attackers full control over the Exchange server, allowing them to execute a range of malicious activities. To evade detection by security products, the malware employs various evasion techniques and disguises itself as a common server component to blend in with normal operations. Furthermore, it can function as a proxy or tunnel, potentially exposing the internal network to external threats or facilitating the exfiltration of sensitive data from internal devices. Our telemetry data indicates that this malware may be part of an APT campaign targeting high-value organizations, including high-tech companies, in Asia. Our team is currently investigating the scope and extent of these attack activities to better understand the threat landscape.
