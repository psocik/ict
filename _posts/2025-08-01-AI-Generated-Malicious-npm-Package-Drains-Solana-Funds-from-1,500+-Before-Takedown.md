Cybersecurity researchers have flagged a malicious npm package that was generated using artificial intelligence (AI) and concealed a cryptocurrency wallet drainer.

The package, @kodane/patch-manager, claims to offer "advanced license validation and registry optimization utilities for high-performance Node.js applications." It was uploaded to npm by a user named "Kodane" on July 28, 2025. The package is no longer available for download from the registry, but not before it attracted over 1,500 downloads.

Software supply chain security company Safety, which discovered the library, said the malicious features are advertised directly in the source code, calling it an "enhanced stealth wallet drainer."
