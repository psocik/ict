An unusually broad coalition composed of the United States, its traditional English-speaking allies, and other nations, including Germany, Italy, and Japan, is calling out three Chinese companies over alleged hacking activity. In a 37-page advisory published on Wednesday, the countries accused the firms - Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology, Beijing Huanyu Tianqiong Information Technology, and Sichuan Zhixin Ruijie Network Technology - of providing "cyber-related products and services to China's intelligence services, including multiple units in the Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army and Ministry of State Security."
