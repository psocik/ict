Skeleton Spider, also known as FIN6, is a long-running financially motivated cybercrime group that has continually evolved its tactics to maximize impact and profit. While the group initially gained notoriety for point-of-sale (POS) breaches and large-scale payment card theft, it has since shifted to broader enterprise threats, including ransomware operations.

In recent years, FIN6 has sharpened its focus on social engineering campaigns that exploit professional trust. By posing as job seekers and initiating conversations through platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed, the group builds rapport with recruiters before delivering phishing messages that lead to malware. One of their preferred payloads is more_eggs, a stealthy JavaScript-based backdoor that facilitates credential theft, system access, and follow-on attacks, including ransomware deployment.

This research combines technical insights and practical analysis for both general audiences and cybersecurity professionals. We examine how FIN6 uses trusted cloud services, such as AWS, to host malicious infrastructure, evade detection, and ultimately deploy malware through socially engineered lures.
