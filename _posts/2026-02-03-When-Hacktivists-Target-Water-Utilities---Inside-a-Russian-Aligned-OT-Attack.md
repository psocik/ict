## Overview

Russian-aligned hacktivist groups are increasingly targeting industrial control systems and OT environments—and sometimes it’s shockingly easy. Daniel dos Santos, VP of Research at Forescout, walks through how his team used a honeypot to observe an attack against a simulated water treatment facility. This observation highlights how honeypots can uncover real-world hacktivist tactics and behaviors. The attack was initially discovered by spotting the honeypot activity through Telegram claims. 

### Key Findings

- A key finding is why exposed HMIs remain one of the weakest entry points in OT environments. 
- The entry point explained in this incident involved default credentials and exposed HMIs. 
- Furthermore, Telegram has become a primary platform for hacktivist attack claims. 
- The evolving motivations behind Russian-aligned hacktivist groups are also notable, with a shift from activism to geopolitics and profit. 

### Defensive Takeaways

OT attacks are challenging to eradicate due to factors like hidden devices and lateral movement. A core defensive takeaway emphasized is not to ignore opportunistic threats. Visibility across all networked devices is critical to defense. Practical steps are necessary to avoid becoming “easy prey” for attackers. Understanding how opportunistic attacks differ from targeted nation-state operations is also important for defense.
