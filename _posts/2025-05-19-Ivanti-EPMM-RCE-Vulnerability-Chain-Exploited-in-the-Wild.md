**Introduction**  
On March 13th, 2025, Ivanti disclosed that Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) is affected by a vulnerability chain combining an authentication bypass (CVE-2025-4427) and a post-authentication remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2025-4428). These flaws, which stem from unsafe use of Java Expression Language in error messages and misconfigured routing, can be exploited together to achieve unauthenticated RCE. Therefore, while neither of these vulnerabilities has been assigned critical severity (their CVSS scores are 5.3 and 7.2, respectively), in combination they should certainly be treated as critical.  
Ivanti has confirmed limited exploitation in the wild of these vulnerabilities as 0-days prior to their disclosure, and Wiz can now confirm ongoing exploitation in the wild of these vulnerabilities.
