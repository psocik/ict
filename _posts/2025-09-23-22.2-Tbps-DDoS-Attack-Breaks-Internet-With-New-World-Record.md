The hyper-volumetric attack peaked at an unprecedented 22.2 terabits per second (Tbps) and 10.6 billion packets per second (Bpps), setting a new and alarming benchmark for the scale of cyber threats. This attack is more than double the size of any previously observed DDoS event, signaling a significant escalation in the capabilities of malicious actors and the botnets they command.

The record-breaking attack was notable not just for its sheer size but also for its short duration. The entire event lasted only about 40 seconds, a tactic designed to overwhelm defenses before they have a chance to respond fully. Attackers are increasingly using these “hit-and-run” DDoS attacks to cause maximum disruption in a minimal timeframe, making automated, real-time detection and mitigation absolutely critical.

According to Cloudflare, its systems autonomously detected and blocked the attack without any human intervention. This successful defense highlights a crucial shift in cybersecurity: the necessity of automated systems powered by machine learning to counter threats that operate at machine speed. Legacy DDoS “scrubbing” centers, which often require manual analysis and traffic redirection, are ill-equipped to handle attacks of this magnitude and velocity.

The critical question for every business is whether its security provider possesses the network capacity and automated technology to withstand such an onslaught. As attackers continue to refine their methods and expand their botnets, the frequency and intensity of hyper-volumetric attacks are expected to grow.
