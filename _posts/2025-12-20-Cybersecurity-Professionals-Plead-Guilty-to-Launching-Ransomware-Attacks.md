In a shocking betrayal of industry trust, two former cybersecurity professionals have pleaded guilty to federal charges for launching ransomware attacks against U.S. businesses. Ryan Clifford Goldberg, a former incident response supervisor at Sygnia Consulting Ltd., and Kevin Tyler Martin, previously a ransomware negotiator for DigitalMint, pleaded guilty on Thursday to one count each of conspiracy to interfere with commerce by extortion.

According to Bloomberg, the group used the notorious ALPHV (BlackCat) ransomware to steal and encrypt victims’ data. They are also accused of splitting their illicit profits with the developers of the ransomware software.

In one high-profile instance detailed in court filings, the group successfully extorted a ransom payment of more than $1 million in cryptocurrency from a Florida-based medical device company.
