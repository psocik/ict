**Executive Summary**  
In July 2025, one of CloudSEK’s premier banking clients had reached out, requesting assistance to investigate a wave of social media content, depicting the rise of a new "finfluencer" named Shewta Sharma. The suspicious nature of Shweta’s guarantees of unrealistic returns from the stock market, aided by an upfront payment, is concerning.  

Shwetha was merely a figure impersonating a popular beauty influencer. Scammers utilized deepfake content to drive engagement to their Telegram channels, withholding the invested money under the guise of stuck payments. They further requested more payments to free up the principal amount, leading to a never-ending cycle. Almost 120 actively running ads were found from various accounts.  

With the number of complaints on the outlet "Consumer Complaints Court" racking up against the bogus finfluencer, including grievances regarding non-payment of money citing various excuses, it creates a cause of concern amongst the general public. This feeds into the FOMO of not investing in the stock market and racking up unrealized returns with unrealistic expectations.  

This report will be providing insights into the wave of content that is aiming to dupe people, helping banks to conduct awareness drives aimed at customers to distrust unreliable finfluencers without any solid background or credentials to back them at handling customers’ hard-earned money.
