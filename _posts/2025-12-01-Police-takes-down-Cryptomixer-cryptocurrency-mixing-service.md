Law enforcement officers from Switzerland and Germany have taken down the Cryptomixer cryptocurrency-mixing service, believed to have helped cybercriminals launder over €1.3 billion in Bitcoin since its launch in 2016.

"Cryptomixer was a hybrid mixing service accessible via both the clear web and the dark web. It facilitated the obfuscation of criminal funds for ransomware groups, underground economy forums, and dark web markets," Europol said.

"Its software blocked the traceability of funds on the blockchain, making it the platform of choice for cybercriminals seeking to launder illegal proceeds from a variety of criminal activities, such as drug trafficking, weapons trafficking, ransomware attacks, and payment card fraud."

Authorities, supported by Europol and Eurojust, seized three servers, over 12 terabytes of data, and the clear web and Tor .onion domains, along with €24 million in Bitcoin.
