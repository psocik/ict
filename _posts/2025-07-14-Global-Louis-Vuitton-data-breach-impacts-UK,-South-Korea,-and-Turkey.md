Customers of French luxury retailer Louis Vuitton are being notified of a data breach affecting multiple countries, including the UK, South Korea, and Turkey.  

The security breach was discovered on July 2nd, 2025, and exposed customer personal information, including names and contact details, but the company confirmed that passwords, payment card data, and other financial information were not compromised. The incident may have impacted customers in other countries as notifications continue.  

Last week the company disclosed that data of some UK customers had been stolen; threat actors had accessed its UK operationâ€™s systems and obtained information such as names, contact details, and purchase history. The brand also said its Korean operation had suffered a similar cyberattack.
