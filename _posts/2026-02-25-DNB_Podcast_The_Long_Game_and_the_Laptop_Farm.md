## DNB Podcast: The Long Game and the Laptop Farm

In this episode of **Dragon News Bytes**, Will Baxter and Eli Woodward sit down in person to dissect the **"long game"** of modern cyber espionage. 🚀 We dive into the Dell RecoverPoint zero-day exploited by China-linked actors and discuss why some threat actors are now sitting silent in networks for over a year before acting. 

We also go full circle on the **DPRK laptop farm saga**, discussing the sentencing of a Ukrainian national who facilitated North Korean IT workers infiltrating U.S. businesses. Finally, we cover **Interpol’s Operation Red Card 2.0**, a massive crackdown on West African scam networks, and why Nigeria’s demographic shift makes it a critical region for defenders to watch over the next decade. 

### Part 1: The One-Year Sleep – Dell Zero-Days & Grim Bolt
